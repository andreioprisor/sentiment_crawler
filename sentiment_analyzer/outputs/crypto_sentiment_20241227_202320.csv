"Powell says Fed cannot hold bitcoin, not seeking to change that",2024-12-18 16:16:00,BTC/USD,"By Michael S. Derby and Ann Saphir

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday the U.S. central bank has no desire to be involved in any government effort to stockpile large amounts of bitcoin.

""We're not allowed to own bitcoin,"" Powell said at a press conference following the Fed's latest two-day policy meeting, in which policymakers cut rates as expected while signaling a less certain path for monetary policy in the months ahead.

In terms of the legal issues around holding bitcoin, ""that's the kind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed,"" Powell said.

The Fed chief was addressing the prospect of central bank involvement in the idea of the government building a so-called Strategic Bitcoin Reserve once President-elect Donald Trump takes office.

Powell's comments on Wednesday dented the value of bitcoin, which has rallied sharply along with other crypto assets since Trump's victory in the Nov. 5 election on the prospect of a more hands-off government approach to a class of assets that rarely functions as actual money, but is instead largely used as a vehicle for speculation.

Trump has suggested he will create a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve - a concept that has also been widely rejected in Europe.

The incoming president has not provided details on what such a reserve would entail, beyond saying its initial holdings could include bitcoin seized from criminals, a stockpile of about 200,000 tokens worth about $21 billion at current prices.

Bitcoin has more than doubled this year to more than $100,000 on optimism over Trump's pro-crypto stance. The asset has proven volatile in its 15 years of existence, which analysts say reduces its utility as a store of value or a unit of exchange, key attributes of a reserve currency.

Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced a bill to create such a reserve, under which the U.S. Treasury would buy 200,000 bitcoins annually until the stockpile reaches one million tokens. The purchases would be funded by Fed bank deposits and gold holdings.

Funding a strategic bitcoin reserve would likely require the approval of Congress and the issuance of new Treasury debt, according to an analysis published this week by  Barclays  (LON:BARC). Given the likely ways such a reserve could be created, ""we suspect such a plan would face stiff resistance from the Fed,"" Barclays analysts said.

EUROPE AGAINST BITCOIN RESERVES

More broadly, Fed officials have been skeptical of securities such as bitcoin as they have also backed away from their own efforts to create a fully digital dollar in favor of allowing the private sector to innovate payments technologies.

The Fed's main role regarding cryptocurrencies appears to center on how those assets might affect consumer and banking sector safety.

""We regulate and supervise banks and we would want the interaction between the crypto business and the banks ... not to threaten the health and well-being of the banks,"" Powell said on Dec. 4. But he also noted at that time that when it comes to crypto assets, ""we don't regulate it directly.""

The European Central Bank’s chief bank supervisor, Claudia Buch, on Tuesday also flagged up risks in the crypto market, including ""excessive leverage, intransparency (and) conflict of interest"", adding she was keeping a close eye on banks' exposure to that type of assets.

Trump plans to appoint former PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) executive David Sacks to the newly-created position of White House AI and Crypto Czar, and pro-crypto consultant Paul Atkins to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In Europe, a series of central bankers this week dismissed any suggestion of bitcoin becoming a reserve asset.



Belgium’s central bank governor Pierre Wunsch saw little ""appetite for having reserves in bitcoins"" in an interview on Wednesday. Outside the euro zone, Hungary’s governor-designate Mihaly Varga said on Monday cryptocurrencies were just too volatile.

""We are following the discussion, especially in the U.S. post-elections, closely,"" ECB policymaker Olli Rehn said on Tuesday. ""But our view has not changed. Cryptos are assets, but they are not currency,"" the Finnish central bank governor added.

Massive 400 Billion SHIB From Early Whale Stuns Major US Exchange,2024-12-19 04:20:00,"BTC/USD, SHIB/USD","U.Today - According to analytics X account @Spotonchain, earlier today, two staggering amounts of Shiba Inu meme coins were sold.

This has happened as the second most popular in the market meme cryptocurrency, SHIB, has demonstrated a roughly 10% price decline as it reacted to Bitcoin’s recent bearish trajectory caused by the Fed Reserve’s statement and the unfulfilled expectations of crypto holders.



That whale purchased a jaw-dropping amount of SHIB on Aug. 7, 2020 – 15.2 trillion – for just 10 ETH.

This early whale now owns two trillion Shiba Inu worth $48.54 million, which constitutes an estimated overall profit of $107.7 million – that is, a 3.7x return from their initial SHIB investment made four years ago.



SHIB went from $0.00002618 down to the $0.00002345 level. By now, this deep decline has been partially recovered as SHIB has increased by a minor 2.64%.

Over the past 10 days, the popular meme cryptocurrency has lost more than 21%, plunging from $0.00003076 to $0.00002409, where it is changing hands at writing time.

Other sources also show that whales have been sending their SHIB coins to exchanges, pushing the price down. The SHIB price mirrors the recent bearish move in the Bitcoin price, as BTC dropped by approximately 5%, briefly crashing below the $100,000 level.

Following the recent announcement that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 25 basis points rather than 100 in 2025, the crypto market took a severe beating. By now, the largest cryptocurrency, BTC, has recovered a little, again trading above $101,000 and coming close to topping $102,000.

Mantle Network Advances Technical Roadmap As The First ZK Validity Rollup with Succinct’s SP1,2024-12-19 05:36:00,,"Singapore, Singapore, December 19th, 2024, Chainwire

Succinct alliance establishes Mantle Network as highest-TVL ZK validity rollup

Mantle Network, an Ethereum layer 2 (L2) known for its modular design and being the first adopter of EigenLayer’s EigenDA, today announced its architectural transition to a zero-knowledge (ZK) validity rollup through an industry-first alliance with Succinct. Combining its modular architecture, data availability solutions through EigenDA, and now zero-knowledge proofs via SP1, Mantle Network embarks on creating the liquidity chain for institutional-grade settlement and value transfer in the crypto ecosystem.

Since Mantle Network’s mainnet launch on July 7, 2023, the burgeoning on-chain ecosystem has grown to become a top 5 L2 by total value locked (TVL) with $2.2 billion and counting. The network has processed 175 million on-chain transactions, seen 1.4 million smart contracts deployed, connected to 10 million unique wallet addresses and maintained 4.9 million monthly active wallet addresses since its inception. Mantle Network continues to drive capital efficiency in the on-chain economy with the integration of ZK validity rollup technology, providing crucial next-generation technical infrastructure to support and amplify secure growth of high-value asset settlements. Backed by one of the largest community-owned treasuries globally with $4.3 billion in asset reserves, Mantle Network’s technical roadmap directly supports its vision of accelerating seamless, secure and efficient movement of institutional capital across traditional and decentralized markets.

Accelerating Institutional-Grade Asset Settlements Through ZK Validity Innovation

With the testnet launch in Q1 2025 with intention towards mainnet upgrade, Mantle Network is set to evolve from an optimistic rollup model to a ZK validity rollup through Succinct’s SP1. This architectural change drastically reduces chain finality from seven days to one hour – enabling fast institutional-grade asset settlements that support and address capital efficiency opportunities throughout traditional finance and the blockchain industry.

The transformative efficiency gains of ZK validity proofs have garnered significant market traction. Already powering applications with a cumulative $4.4 billion capital across leading ZK L2 ecosystems, Mantle Network maintains a bullish belief in the advancement of ZK technology to further the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Performance benefits can allow Mantle’s flagship assets, such as $mETH, $cmETH and $FBTC, with an aggregate $3.9 billion TVL, to proliferate across the wider decentralized finance (DeFi) domain. This enables better swap market spreads, lower slippage, deeper money markets, improved interest rates, and broader asset availability. Market intermediaries can rapidly rebalance inventories between Mantle Network (Layer 2) and Ethereum (Layer 1), and users can quickly move permissionlessly to access a unique set of onward routes and integrations.

Key Technical Benefits

The strategic integration of Succinct’s SP1 offers a suite of advanced features catered to developers and users:



OP Succinct combines the power of Succinct’s SP1 zkVM with the modularity of the OP Stack, bridging the gap between user-friendly optimistic rollups and complex zero-knowledge technology. The innovation promotes interoperability, flexibility, and standardization that addresses Ethereum’s existing challenges. By adopting ZK validity proofs, Mantle Network transactions are cryptographically verified to be correctly sequenced and settled. This higher tier of security allows everyone to more easily and safely explore frontier areas that enhance the Ethereum experience — such as supporting more advanced application logic, enabling cross-chain actions, improving latency, and adopting multi-sequencer architectures.



The synergy of fast finality, Ethereum-standard compatibility, and cost efficiency promises a profound impact, reducing fragmentation and unlocking the potential for next-generation decentralized applications (dApps).

The transition enhances Mantle Network’s commitment to Ethereum’s decentralized security model as an ETH-aligned Layer 2, enabling a more cohesive ecosystem with seamless asset and information flows. Mantle Network is now poised to be a future-ready L2 chain as a native ZK rollup.

As the Ethereum landscape evolves, Mantle Network’s adoption of Succinct’s SP1 positions it as a leader in scalability and innovation. Developers, users, and ecosystem partners can look forward to a faster, more secure, and interconnected Ethereum future.

"131.2 Million SHIB Torched, But There's Big Catch Here",2024-12-19 07:03:00,SHIB/USD,"U.Today - The Shibburn data tracking platform has revealed that the SHIB community has succeeded in removing SHIB meme coins from circulation. However, there is nuance with this massive burn that does not make it look that good.

This coincided with the large SHIB price drop by roughly 10%.



As for daily SHIB burns, things look more optimistic here in terms of the burn rate reading: +69.28%. However, the amount of burned Shiba Inu meme coins is 21.8x smaller and comprises 6,181,175 meme coins. It was achieved thanks to eight burn transactions. The largest ones burned 2,874,467; 1,701,750; 1,463,776 and 1,000,000 SHIB.

According to Shibburn, by now, a total of 410,742,824,445,039 SHIB have been transferred to unspendable wallets, while 584,120,275,779,942 SHIB keep circulating on the cryptocurrency market.



The bigger transaction, carrying 400 billion SHIB, was tracked by @spotonchain. The funds were sent to Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, Tyler and Cameron, based in the U.S. The 400 billion SHIB is valued at $9.69 million.

The second transaction was reported by the @lookonchain account as the same early SHIB investor transferred 250 billion SHIB. The destination was not mentioned. After buying 15.2 trillion Shiba Inu and the recent sales, this whale now holds roughly two trillion SHIB worth $48.54 million in fiat.



Not only SHIB but the whole cryptocurrency market followed the brief plunge of the world’s pioneer cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, as it crashed below $100,000 as the Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced that the upcoming interest rate cut would constitute only 25 basis points rather than 100 basis points, as was expected by the global crypto community.

"Bybit x Block Scholes Crypto Derivatives Report: BTC at All-Time High, ETH Options Signal Momentum",2024-12-19 09:15:00,"BTC/USD, ETH/USD","Dubai, United Arab Emirates, December 19th, 2024, Chainwire

Bybit, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, today released its latest crypto derivatives analytics report in collaboration with Block Scholes. The report explores the current state of the crypto market, analyzing macro events, trading signals across spot and derivatives markets, including futures, options, and perpetual contracts.

Key Findings:

Bitcoin (BTC) Surges to All-Time High, Derivatives Markets Show Cautious Optimism

Despite a record-breaking spot price for BTC, the derivatives market reflects a more measured approach compared to previous highs this quarter. This suggests a potential reset in leverage after last week's de-levering activity, leading to normalized funding rates, slower futures yield growth, and reduced preference for call options. Interestingly, futures exposure remains heavily concentrated in December's end-of-year BTC contracts, with limited growth observed during the recent spot rally. Additionally, perpetual swap markets have seen funding rates return to neutral levels after a period of excessive leverage.

Ethereum (ETH) Options Market Hints at Bullish Sentiment

In contrast to the cautious derivatives activity surrounding BTC, the options market for ETH paints a different picture. Open interest in ETH call options remains significantly higher than out-of-the-money (OTM) puts, indicating a continued bullish sentiment among options traders.

‘Probably Nothing’ – Michael Saylor Highlights These Huge Daily Bitcoin ETF Inflows,2024-12-19 10:09:00,"MSTR, HUT","U.Today - Michael Saylor, who founded MicroStrategy and spearheads it first as the CEO and now as an executive chairman, has published an important X post about Bitcoin spot ETFs.



Those inflows comprise hundreds of millions of US dollars. The smallest one constituted $103 million on November 27. The largest one comprised $766.66 million on December 5. The most recent inflow featured in the table on the screenshot was registered on November 18 and was $275.39 million.

“Probably nothing,” Michael Saylor tweeted. The Bitcoin ETFs were approved for trading in January this year. Since then, more than a dozen Bitcoin funds entered the market and began accumulating BTC on a daily basis.



The miner has acquired this BTC batch for approximately $100 million, paying roughly $101,710 per coin on average. Similar to Saylor’s company, Hut8 is building up its own strategic Bitcoin reserve which after this new acquisition constitutes more than 10,000 BTC worth approximately $1 billion as of December 18.

El Salvador says it will keep buying bitcoin despite IMF warning,2024-12-19 10:18:00,BTC/USD,"By Nelson Renteria

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) -El Salvador said on Thursday it would keep buying bitcoin, possibly at an accelerated pace, a day after the government reached a financing agreement with the International Monetary Fund that had said it should limit its exposure to the cryptocurrency.

Stacy Herbert, El Salvador's national bitcoin office director, wrote on X that bitcoin would remain legal tender in the Central American country, and that the government would keep adding to its strategic reserves.

On Wednesday, El Salvador struck a $1.4 billion loan deal with the IMF, as part of which the government of President Nayib Bukele agreed that it would scale back its bitcoin policies. The deal specified that tax payments will only be made in the other official tender, the U.S. dollar.

IMF spokesperson Julie Kozack said on Thursday that planned legal reforms in El Salvador would make acceptance of bitcoin by the private sector voluntary.

The government's announcement that it would make more bitcoin purchases ""might be just a way to counter any negative blowback"" from a perceived diminished status of the cryptocurrency in El Salvador, said Eugene Epstein, head of trading and structured products for North America at Moneycorp in New Jersey.

""Given the size and likely the terms of the IMF deal, it was probably worth for (Bukele) to do that.""

El Salvador owns 5,968 coins, valued at $594 million. Bitcoin has rallied in recent days after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump reiterated plans for a strategic reserve for the cryptocurrency, similar to a strategic oil reserve.

In September 2021, El Salvador became the first country to make the cryptocurrency a legal tender, alongside the dollar. That caused friction with the IMF, which warned of financial and legal risks that it recently said ""have not materialized.""



Bukele has been hyping the country's status as a hub for the promotion of digital currency trading, hosting an ""Adopting Bitcoin"" conference last month.

The country is also home to ""Bitcoin Beach,"" a surfing spot aimed at tourists, where businesses have started to adopt bitcoin as a form of payment.

$250 Million in Bitcoin and Ethereum Stun Major US Exchange Coinbase,2024-12-19 11:55:00,"BTC/USD, ETH/USD","U.Today - This year, the correlation between the cryptocurrency market and traditional finance is more entrenched than ever before. This was largely due to the introduction of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds, the arrival of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), VanEck, Fidelity and many other giant financial institutions to the market.

On the one hand, the market has seen a great leap in adoption, but on the other hand, its independence and originality have noticeably decreased, and the movements of a number of cryptocurrencies are repeating the performance of key stock market indices. We mean the U.S. stock market, of course.

Now, in anticipation of the opening of the U.S. market, one can often see large movements of cryptocurrencies, mainly the same BTC and ETH. Sometimes, however, these transfers cause more excitement than most.

For example, in the last hour, such a surprise was caused by the transfer of 1,762 BTC, which is equivalent to almost $180 million, as well as 20,467 ETH, equal to about $75.46 million.

Such moves from unknown wallets to centralized exchanges are causing excitement among crypto market participants, due to the fact that they are considered a harbinger of an imminent sale by a major player.

Whether that is the case here is an open question. Nevertheless, right now, the price of Bitcoin is not falling, but even on the contrary is cheerfully green by more than 2.1%, which is very impressive for an asset with a capitalization of more than $2 trillion. The price of Ethereum is also trading in the plus side since the opening of the trading day.

Losses from crypto hacks jump to $2.2 billion in 2024- report,2024-12-19 13:04:00,,"Investing.com -- Cryptocurrency platforms lost $2.2 billion in 2024, from hacking, a jump of 21% from last year, according to Chainalysis.

This marks the fourth consecutive year losses have exceeded $1 billion, with incidents rising to 303 from 282 in 2023.

The surge comes as bitcoin soared 140% this year, surpassing $100,000 and attracting institutional investors and support from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.

""As the digital asset market booms, it is typical to see the illicit use of crypto grow in tandem,"" Chainalysis' cybercrimes research lead Eric Jardine said.

Most stolen funds resulted from private key breaches, primarily targeting centralized platforms. Major hacks included $305 million from Japan's DMM Bitcoin in May and $235 million from India’s WazirX in July.

North Korea-linked crypto theft hit a record $1.3 billion in 2024, more than doubling from last year, the report said. The UN has previously stated that cryptocurrency helps North Korea evade sanctions, a claim the country denies.

"Worldcoin must delete all iris scan data, watchdog says",2024-12-19 14:11:00,,"MADRID (Reuters) - Sam Altman's company Worldcoin must delete all iris scanning data collected since the start of the project that has sparked privacy concerns in several countries, Spanish data protection watchdog AEPD said on Thursday.

AEPD cited a decision earlier on Thursday by its Bavarian counterpart BayLDA, with whom the agency has cooperated on the case, that found the venture in breach of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation.

World, as Worldcoin has rebranded itself, has its European headquarters in the German city of Erlangen, in Bavaria.

Spain's High Court in March upheld a temporary ban on the iris-scanning venture, dismissing an appeal by Worldcoin owners.



Co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in 2019, Worldcoin aims to create a global identity system by getting people to have their irises scanned in exchange for free cryptocurrency and a digital ID.



(This story has been corrected to clarify that the AEPD was referring to a decision by its German counterpart, not its own, and to specify that Worldcoin’s European headquarters is in Bavaria)

WhiteBIT’s Institutional Focus Drives Trading Volume to Record $2.7 Trillion in 2024,2024-12-20 04:05:00,,"Vilnius, Lithuania, December 20th, 2024, Chainwire

Europe’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, WhiteBIT, concludes the year with notable achievements. The latest estimates reveal the company’s capitalization has reached $38.9 billion, while the annual trading volume surged to $2.7 trillion — a 200% increase compared to the previous year. These figures encompass all exchange markets (spot and futures), showcasing the company’s rapid growth and the increasing trust of its users.

For context, WhiteBIT’s trading volume surpassed major players like Kraken, whose annual trading volume stood at $628 billion. WhiteBIT’s trading volume exceeds the GDP of countries like Italy or Canada and approaches the GDP of France, valued at $3 trillion.



In the fall of 2024, WhiteBIT secured its position as the second-most visited crypto exchange, with 33 million visits to the platform. This achievement positions it just behind Binance, reflecting the steady interest in WhiteBIT’s services.

Key Drivers of Growth

One of the primary contributors to WhiteBIT’s record trading volume has been the onboarding of institutional clients. The exchange introduced a market maker program tailored to the requirements of large-scale traders. With low fees and rebates as high as -0.01%, the program provided conditions for high-frequency trading, drawing professional traders to the platform. Institutional loans also became a cornerstone for building trust within the professional community, enabling large-scale transactions.

The platform’s technical infrastructure also contributed, with features such as colocation to reduce latency, sub-accounts for strategy diversification, and a robust API supporting its services for institutional clients.

The introduction of a new affiliate program contributed by engaging communities of retail traders, supporting user acquisition, and enhancing trading activity, which played a role in WhiteBIT’s strong performance.

Currently, the exchange serves over 1,300 institutional clients.

Expanding Global Reach

Today, over 30 million people worldwide use services and products from the WhiteBIT Group holding. These include the centralized exchange WhiteBIT, the crypto payment solution Whitepay, the decentralized exchange WhiteSwap, the NFT marketplace white.market, and the gaming platform Pocket Rocket. Additionally, WhiteBIT Group encompasses Whitechain, its proprietary blockchain, and WhiteBIT Coin (WBT), which has experienced 349.39% growth over the year.

With 600+ trading pairs and more than 300 digital assets, WhiteBIT continues to strengthen its competitive edge in the global market.

In a recent interview, CEO Volodymyr Nosov confirmed WhiteBIT’s plans to enter the US market.

Commitment to Security

WhiteBIT stands out as one of the most secure cryptocurrency exchanges globally. Ranked among top 5 in security by CER.live, it is the first crypto exchange to achieve the highest-level Cryptocurrency Security Standard (CCSS) certification.

The platform also holds a Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) certification, safeguarding customer payment information, and has been recognized by Hacken for excellence in cybersecurity.

WhiteBIT remains committed to continuous growth, solidifying its position in the international market, and expanding its impact on the global crypto ecosystem.

"Dogecoin Founder Says ‘WAGMI’ as Bitcoin, DOGE Prices Crash",2024-12-20 04:15:00,"BTC/USD, ETH/USD, DOGE/USD","U.Today - Billy Markus, one of the two founders of the original meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin, launched in 2013, has published a post where he commented on the massive price fall faced by Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin, along with the rest of the crypto market, over the last 24 hours.

On social media, Markus is widely known under the alias Shibetoshi Nakamoto. In this post, the popular ""WAGMI"" acronym was mentioned, which is supposed to be bullish and optimistic.



In that screenshot, Bitcoin dropped below the $98,000 level, but in the past hour, the world’s flagship crypto has extended its crash by going down to $96,076 per coin. Overall, since Thursday, this constitutes a 6.45% decline from the $102,000 price mark.

Shibetoshi Nakamoto’s brainchild, Dogecoin, has crashed harder, falling by almost 17% from $0.36668 to $0.30491, where it is currently changing hands.

The second biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum, has experienced an 11.2% crash, rapidly declining from $3,711 to $3,301 as of this writing.

The crypto market has faced stunning losses as $1.2 billion worth of crypto has been wiped out. Among those, the liquidations of long positions constituted the majority of the losses - $1.07 billion triggered by the speech of the Fed Reserve chairman Jerome Powell that the U.S. central bank intends to drastically reduce interest rate cuts. The next easing will be 25 basis points rather than 100, as was expected by crypto fans and the financial community in general.



Shibetoshi Nakamoto reacted by posting an animated GIF to agree with that statement. But that response also seems rather ironic.

'Rich Dad Poor Dad' Author Reveals Big 'Bitcoin Secret': Details,2024-12-20 06:00:00,BTC/USD,"U.Today - Robert Kiyosaki, entrepreneur, Bitcoin investor and author of the popular wealth management book “Rich Dad Poor Dad” has addressed the crypto community, as Bitcoin collapsed first below the $100,000 level, and by now, it has gone under $95,000.

He revealed to them an important detail - one may say a secret - about digital gold, which many newbies in crypto investment often miss.



Kiyosaki tweeted that this is what “the beauty of Bitcoin’s design” is about “it is never too late to start...regardless of how high Bitcoin price goes.”

Robert Kiyosaki believes that the largest global cryptocurrency is “designed to make everyone rich,” even those who begin to accumulate BTC late. Now that Bitcoin has fallen below $95,000, many Bitcoin influencers say that it is a great opportunity to start buying the BTC dip. But Kiyosaki warns: “Just don’t get greedy.”



The new president actively accepted donations for his campaign in crypto before the election, and he made several promises to the community about crypto, including the removal of current anti-crypto SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, the release of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht from his double life sentence in prison and fair cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S.

In November, Bitcoin started growing, and thanks to further bullish drivers, it broke above the $108,000 level in early December, establishing three consecutive all-time highs above $100,000.

Kiyosaki also recommended that the community start accumulating Satoshis – Bitcoin subunits – before they skyrocket to $106,000 each. BTC helps everyone to get rich, Kiyosaki believes.

Samson Mow on Bitcoin Crash: 'Supply Shock Is Coming',2024-12-20 06:03:00,"MSTR, BTC/USD","U.Today - Thus far this week, the crypto market has tasted two extreme sides of price movement, with Bitcoin soaring to an all-time high (ATH) above $108,000 while dropping as low as $95,587.68. The week also saw a massive accumulation streak from top pro-Bitcoin firms. Despite this trend, Bitcoin prices still fell off, and Samson Mow has broken the silence on what is happening.



Earlier this week, MicroStrategy bought another $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin to increase its total holdings to 439,000 BTC. Beyond MicroStrategy, other smaller firms with Bitcoin treasuries, including MARA Holdings, also announced major purchases, effectively depleting the coin’s circulating supply.

Amid this buy-ups, the market has not moved past the $108,000 level; rather, it has failed to maintain support around the $100,000 mark.

In his reaction, Samson Mow said investors need to trust their instincts and understand that a ""supply shock is coming.""



As of writing time, the price of Bitcoin has dropped 3.54% in 24 hours to $95243.24. Amid the ongoing freefall, the coin is bound to see a major retest of this level, as it has formed a strong support around this price range over the past month.

Bitcoin ETFs Witness Largest Outflow in History,2024-12-20 06:40:00,"BTC/USD, ETH/USD","U.Today - There has been a major change in the cryptocurrency world as Bitcoin ETFs have had their biggest net outflow since they were created, with a total of $671.9 million. This sudden move breaks the pattern of steady inflows and adds a significant detail to the story of how institutions are engaging with digital assets. The biggest outflow was from Fidelity's FBTC, with a major withdrawal of $208.5 million.

On the other hand, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s IBIT ETF remained steady, showing no net changes - a stark difference from the overall trend.

What makes this turn particularly interesting is that it comes after a 15-day streak of inflows for Bitcoin ETFs - a period of growth that had been uninterrupted until now. The impact was not just felt on Bitcoin ETFs either. Ethereum ETFs also lost steam, breaking an 18-day streak of consistent inflows.

The market correction for these funds happened after a year of total inflows of $37 billion, showing how overoptimistic people were and how much the market has dropped recently.



It is almost like this was bound to happen. We have seen some major inflows recently, which have set the bar pretty high and made this reversal more significant. But it also shows how quickly confidence can waver when big economic uncertainties and price corrections come into play.

For now, this huge outflow just leaves us with questions. Are investors taking a step back to rethink their strategies, or is this the start of a more cautious phase in the crypto ETF story? The answer might be in how these funds bounce back but also in how they adapt to markets that keep going up and down.

Expert Trader Predicts When Bitcoin (BTC) Bulls 'Will Try to Make a Stand',2024-12-20 10:17:00,BTC/USD,"U.Today - Popular crypto trader known online by the nickname DonAlt shared an updated outlook on the price of Bitcoin (BTC). The price of the major cryptocurrency has lost over 14% in the last three days and is currently trading at just under $94,000 per BTC. While such poor performance by Bitcoin in recent days has caused massive liquidations in the altcoin space, it has also brought back a sense of fear, uncertainty and doubt among market participants.

That is why it is worth paying attention to the sentiment of the most popular and established public traders in the cryptocurrency space right now.

For example, in his post, DonAlt discusses that the painful drop of the Bitcoin price to almost $90,000 has led to a major liquidation of altcoins, bringing many of them back to bear market valuations.

At the same time, the trader offers a vision where a price range between $85,000 and $90,000 per BTC is likely - where bullish investors might try to stabilize and push the price further, indicating a potential support zone for Bitcoin.

As can be seen on the attached chart, the next major trading range, if the above is breached, will be the $85,000-$71,500 area. Interestingly enough, this is also the area where the unclosed gap for Bitcoin on the CME is located.

Thus, at first glance, it is all doom and gloom. What brings enthusiasm is that the area outlined by DonAlt is almost there, so we can hope for a bullish reaction there. However, considering the year-end tendencies on the crypto market, the roller coaster ride may last for quite some time.

Mystery 666 BTC Transfer Leads to Half Billion Bitcoin Puzzle,2024-12-20 10:35:00,BTC/USD,"U.Today - While the crypto market continues to wipe out deposits on a large scale and liquidate overly greedy and late traders, large-scale cryptocurrency transfers involving unknown wallets continue to take place in the background. One such attention-grabbing transfer was the transfer of 666 BTC, which at current prices is equivalent to $62.17 million.

According to Whale Alert, this transfer took place from an unknown wallet under the address “3NVeX” to the address which, according to the tracking service, belongs to Antpool, which is one of the largest mining pools in the industry.

Interestingly, at the same time, data from Arkham Intelligence shows that the transfer was made not to the address of the mining pool but to the custodial account of Cobo's, which is a popular Web3 wallet platform.

This address, however, was not the last stop for the Bitcoin (BTC) data, when another 17 BTC and a transfer of 683 coins was made to an unknown address, “3BHXy.” This Arkham address is also suspected to belong to Cobo, and its balance right now contains 5,435 BTC, which is equivalent to $511.53 million.

Such transfers excite the crypto public because they are often associated with the sale or purchase of cryptocurrency by a major player.

However, here, it is likely that this is not the case, and it is most likely just a transfer of Bitcoin from one pocket to another. Thus, it can be concluded that the only sinister thing here is the initial amount of the transfer.

"DOGE Founder Reacts to Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Ethereum Sell-off",2024-12-20 10:55:00,"BTC/USD, ETH/USD, DOGE/USD","U.Today - Billy Markus, founder of Dogecoin (DOGE) known on social media as Shibetoshi Nakamoto, dropped a cryptic post on X. The post reflects his reaction to the rapid decline witnessed in the prices of Bitcoin (BTC), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum (ETH).



The listed prices show a significant drop in BTC, DOGE and ETH. This reflects the huge bearish sentiment that has affected the coins. As a result of these sell-offs, Bitcoin ETFs have registered the largest outflows as the bears dominate the market.

Despite this massive decline, Markus's tone has a hint of humor, best described as sarcastic. Many consider the post to have a deeper meaning of preparing to take advantage of the decline in the price of the assets.

Markus could be preparing to buy the dip in anticipation of a price rebound, which is likely to result in profit-taking.

The Dogecoin founder’s post has elicited reactions from his followers and many users of the different coins. Some users believe the price drop is a great opportunity for investors to accumulate ahead of the next bull wave.

Bitcoin crossed the psychological price level of $100,000 for the first time and soared to over $108,200. Many investors were engaged in profit-taking, particularly early traders who purchased when BTC traded below $80,000.



DOGE’s price crashed by 20.49% to $0.289 within 24 hours. Dogecoin’s market volume has soared by 107.95% to $13.58 billion. Ethereum has also registered a surge in market volume by 47.64% to $75.88 billion, even with a notable price decline of 12.33% to $3,230.49.

Analysts say all three coins have continued to soar in market volume, signaling investors’ confidence in the assets. These investors might be positioning themselves for future market rebounds.

Bitcoin Comeback? Ex-Binance CEO CZ Teases New All-Time High,2024-12-20 11:13:00,"BTC/USD, ETH/USD, SOL/USD","U.Today - Looking at the current situation on the cryptocurrency market, one can wonder how everything was ""blooming and smelling"" three days ago. Back then, Bitcoin (BTC) was trading above $108,000, Ethereum was valued at an arm's length away from $4,000 and Solana failed to collapse 34% from its all-time high.

Few would have thought the situation could change so much by Friday, but there is one person in the crypto market who planted the seed of such an idea.

We are talking about Changpeng Zhao, or CZ as he is better known in the crypto space, the former head of the world's largest crypto exchange, Binance.

In a tweet dated Dec. 17, CZ stated in one of his tweets that he was waiting for headlines as the price of Bitcoin dropped from $101,000 to $85,000 and also quite ambitiously asked to ""save this tweet."" Fast forward three days, and here we are.

The concerned crypto public did not fail to call out the former Binance CEO for such predictions, to which he responded with a more bullish post. Zhao stated that we should expect to see more headlines discussing Bitcoin hitting an all-time high, and moreover, it will continue ""again, and again, and again,"" according to CZ.

Zhao mentioned the cyclical nature of the cryptocurrency market earlier. Based on what he said, it was assumed that similar to previous market events, a real bull market could occur in 2025, while this year is more of a recovery phase after a bear market.

Whether CZ's expectations come true or not, and whether Bitcoin will update its all-time high, we will find out in the very near future.

"Jim Cramer Says 'Buy Fear, Not Sell It,' Crypto Community Reacts",2024-12-20 11:18:00,BTC/USD,"U.Today - Financial commentator and Mad Money host Jim Cramer has published a tweet about the U.S. government shutdown that is more than likely to happen this Saturday.

It is expected to be caused by the newly elected U.S. president disapproving the funding bill for the year 2025, which includes pay rises and multiple benefits for congressmen from the Democratic party. Tech magnate and head of D.O.G.E. Elon Musk also paid attention to that bill, speaking against it on X.



Jim Cramer tweeted that he had studied every governmental shutdown “since the time of Bill Clinton” regarding the way to react best to it investment-wise. Therefore, Cramer said, “You always had to BUY the fear not sell it.”



Now that Cramer has tweeted about “buying the fear” and not selling it, many commentators, including cryptocurrency fans, began tweeting that it is definitely worth selling, not buying.

Over the last 24 hours, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has shed a large part of its gains added over the last month. Bitcoin declined by almost 10%, falling from the $102,450 zone and landing at $92,951. By now, BTC has rebounded a little and is changing hands at $95,200. The key reason for the rapid and deep Bitcoin decline was the recent statement by Federal Reserve boss Jerome Powell about the Fed planning to reduce the high pace of interest rate cutting next year. Rather than the 100-basis-point cut expected by the crypto community, the Fed plans to do a 25-basis-point cut in early 2025.

Bitcoin (BTC) Hourly Death Cross Emerges: Details,2024-12-20 11:27:00,BTC/USD,"U.Today - Bitcoin (BTC) is facing a bearish short-term indication, with a ""death cross"" appearing on its hourly chart. Bitcoin's 50-hour moving average has markedly fallen below the 200-hour moving average, confirming a ""death cross.""

The bearish signal comes amid a broader market sell-off, which has led to $1.42 billion in crypto liquidations over the past 24 hours, per CoinGlass data. Bitcoin has not been immune to this bearishness, with its price falling as traders faced uncertainty.

Bitcoin fell by more than 11% from a record high of $108,268 achieved earlier this week, on Dec. 17, as lesser prospects for looser U.S. monetary policy dampened speculative fervor.

In the most recent data release on Friday, the personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's favored inflation indicator, showed a 0.1% increase from October and an annual rate of 2.4%, both lower than expected.

The data comes just two days after the Fed dropped its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 4.25%-4.5%, the lowest level in two years. During his news conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell struck a hawkish tone about the forecast for next year. Fed policymakers raised their inflation outlook and projected only two rate cuts in 2025, down from four previously predicted.

With fewer Fed rate cuts projected in 2025, some investors may decide to reduce their exposure and take profits, hence the sell-off.



While death crosses are often viewed as bearish, they do not always guarantee further declines. The market is now closely monitoring Bitcoin's support levels, with $90,000 being a critical psychological barrier to watch if selling pressure continues.

On the upside, if the rebound is sustained, the $99,974 level might be critical to watch out for. If the Bitcoin price rebounds off this level with strength, the chances of retesting above the $100,000 psychological level increase. This might take Bitcoin beyond $108,000, with potential targets of $113,000 and $125,000.

Michael Saylor Issues Bitcoin Statement Amid Ongoing Crypto Market Turmoil,2024-12-20 11:31:00,"MSTR, BTC/USD","U.Today - Michael Saylor, Chairman of MicroStrategy business intelligence firm, dropped his usual post on X. The message reflects Saylor’s bullish disposition to Bitcoin (BTC) regardless of market dynamics. As the current price rapidly declines, Saylor has ignored the gloom and issued a notable message to Bitcoin investors.



Despite the tense atmosphere, Saylor maintains that investors must wear a hard hat as the market suffers, which could be a momentary crash.

Notably, workers stay safe on a construction site by wearing a hard hat to protect themselves from crashing objects. Saylor appears to have the same advice for Bitcoin investors to protect themselves.

Analysts suggest that investors could use stop-loss orders, hedge with derivatives or monitor market sentiments in a crashing market. However, the Bitcoin advocate would rather stay calm and stick to his Bitcoin accumulation plan for Saylor.



When Bitcoin hit $100,700 after suffering a momentary dip, Saylor rejected the idea of selling for profit-taking in an interview. He maintained that the Bitcoin community would never trust MicroStrategy should it decide to sell BTC. This highlights Saylor's and MicroStrategy's holding strategy.

Meanwhile, Saylor has hinted at changing MicroStrategy’s fundraising approach to add more intelligent leverage. Having achieved targets faster than anticipated, Saylor says the company will continue to raise capital primarily via fixed-income markets.

He believes the company needs more leverage to compensate for its increasing deleveraged position.

"Bitcoin (BTC) Loses $100,000: What's Next? Ethereum (ETH) To Never See $4,000? Solana (SOL) Great Reset Is Incoming",2024-12-20 19:01:00,"BTC/USD, ETH/USD, SOL/USD","U.Today - Bitcoin experienced a sharp decline, falling to $94,000 from its peak of over $100,000. As the market struggles with a change in momentum, a retracement is looming on the horizon. Although some people may find the price correction concerning, there are important trends and dynamics to keep an eye on that suggest what Bitcoin may do next. The short-term rising trendline that supported Bitcoin during its most recent rally is broken below on the chart.

This breakdown implies that short-term bullish momentum is waning. The psychological level of $90,000 and the 50 EMA at $91,798 are the next significant support levels to keep an eye on. If buyers take action, these levels might serve as a buffer against additional drops. The last few sessions have seen a noticeable increase in selling pressure, according to volume analysis.

But the RSI, which is at 43 right now, shows that Bitcoin is getting close to oversold territory. Bulls can regroup during this dynamic, which frequently occurs before a possible relief rally or consolidation period. The larger picture shows that Bitcoin is still above its 100 EMA ($82,971), which has historically served as a solid support level during market downturns. The entire bullish structure will continue to exist as long as this level is maintained.

Rebounding above $97,000 would indicate a resurgence and potentially spark a new rally. Looking ahead, Bitcoin's trajectory will depend on the market's capacity to maintain important support levels. Should selling pressure persist, the $85,000 zone may be tested by a more severe correction. Bitcoin might, however, stabilize and try to recover $100,000 if buyers regain control, indicating a resurgence of market confidence.



When this level is broken, it indicates that ETH has lost a lot of momentum, which puts the market in jeopardy. The significant trading volume that coincided with the sell-off raises additional concerns because it implies that the market is actively participating in the decline. At $3,033, the 100 EMA provides the next important level of support.

Ethereum may experience additional drops and possibly test the psychological $3,000 barrier if it is unable to maintain this line. To restore investor confidence and pave the way for a possible rally, ETH must rise back above $3,800. At 35, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests that Ethereum is getting close to oversold territory. Bulls may find some hope in this since relief rallies have historically resulted from similar circumstances.

Any upward movement, though, is probably going to encounter strong opposition at the $3,500 and $3,800 levels. In a larger sense, Ethereum's market difficulties reflect the mood of the market as a whole, with riskier assets under pressure due to tightening macroeconomic conditions.



As selling pressure increases, traders' increasing agreement about the possibility of additional downside is frequently indicated by this volume spike. More market participants may be adopting a bearish stance as a result of the increased activity during this downward move, which reflects a general lack of confidence in Solana's performance going forward. This downturn has worrying ramifications.

Solana may test support at $150, a crucial psychological barrier, if the 200 EMA is breached, which could lead to even lower levels. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is currently at 31, is getting close to oversold territory but has not yet indicated a definite reversal. This allows for additional downward movement prior to a possible rebound.

Bearish sentiment on the main cryptocurrency markets exacerbates Solana's difficulties on the larger market stage. Investor confidence may be further damaged if the 200 EMA is not broken, which could result in a protracted bearish phase. But if SOL can maintain this level, it may draw in investors seeking a long-term entry point, which could stabilize the asset.

'Rich Dad Poor Dad' Author Names Best Assets for Your Money,2024-12-21 03:13:00,"GC, SI, BTC/USD","U.Today - In a recent tweet, Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the popular book on managing finance “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” investor and entrepreneur, raised the topic of Bitcoin, U.S. government spending and the Fed Reserve.

He also made an important warning to the financial markets as to how he sees their nearest future.



Kiyosaki also reminded his readers about president Nixon removing the gold standard that had been used to back the U.S. dollar until then: “Nixon took the US dollar off the gold standard.”

It was then, the financial expert revealed, that he began to “save” gold, silver, and these days he is saving Bitcoin.

Today, he said, “the best assets for your money are real gold, silver, and Bitcoin.”



However, he believes that saving Bitcoin, physical gold and silver can save one’s wealth, and it is much safer to invest in those rather than saving fiat money and investing in assets based on fiat money.



So far, he has recommended that the community should start accumulating Bitcoin in parts, buying Satoshis, since one single BTC back then was worth more than $106,000. After that BTC soared above $108,000. From Tuesday to Friday, Bitcoin plummeted by 15%, falling from $108,380 to $92,640 on the news of the Fed Reserve planning to reduce its dovish policy and make a much smaller interest rate cut next year. By now, Bitcoin has managed to recover 7%, rising to $99,150.

Michael Saylor Reveals Strategic Bitcoin-Based Digital Asset Policy for US,2024-12-21 06:40:00,"NDX, BTC/USD","U.Today - Michael Saylor, a vocal Bitcoin evangelist and co-founder of the MicroStrategy giant, has published a post on the X social media platform, offering to readers’ attention his strategic digital asset policy that “can strengthen the U.S. dollar” and help America experience a large economic boost in the 21st century.

The document revealing details of that concept was published on Michael Saylor’s personal website.



It suggests dividing digital assets into several groups, establishing legitimacy for them, setting up “rational compliance” as well as offering a vision of “Capital Markets Renaissance.”

As part of this concept, Saylor believes it is necessary to divide digital assets into several categories. That includes a “digital commodity,” i.e., assets without an issuer and backed by digital power, such as Bitcoin; a “digital security,” which is “An asset with an issuer, backed by a security (e.g., equity, debt, derivatives).”



The above-mentioned document also includes a section about the creation of a “robust framework of rights and responsibilities” targeted at asset issuers, exchanges and asset owners in order “to engage in digital asset markets with confidence.”

A key principle for implementing the concept and following it afterward says: “No one has the right to lie, cheat, or steal. All participants are civilly and criminally responsible for their actions.”



As of late, these accumulations have been made thanks to the debt raised by the company from shareholders who receive yields on their indirect Bitcoin investments in MicroStrategy.

"Balaji Srinivasan on Bitcoin, AI: 'Going Vertical'",2024-12-21 07:23:00,"COIN, BITO","U.Today - Renowned tech visionary Balaji Srinivasan, former CTO of Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) and GP of Andreessen Horowitz, shows two charts to display the rocketing opportunities of AI large language models (LLMs) and Bitcoin ETFs. Both are in their ""vertical"" growth phases, he says.



To demonstrate the traction of Bitcoin (BTC) and AI, Srinivasan shared two charts. The first one demonstrates the opportunities of OpenAI's flagship models to solve various tasks. It is measured by Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) benchmarks.

Yesterday, Dec. 20, 2024, OpenAI's much-anticipated o3 model set a new record, hitting 87.5% on ARC-AGI public data set. As demonstrated by Balaji Srinivasan, this is a 10x more powerful result compared to GPT-4o, the strongest of ChatGPT's mainstream models today.

In turn, GPT-4o performs 500% better than GPT-3, the model that kickstarted the AI euphoria in 2023.

The second chart by Balaji Srinivasan showcases the dynamics of USD-denominated AUM of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) iShares ETFs on Gold and spot Bitcoin. Launched less than one year ago, BlackRock's Bitcoin spot ETFs exceeded their Gold-based predecessors by almost 73%.



Bitcoin spot ETFs in the U.S. were approved Jan. 11, 2024. In total, they amassed $113 billion in AUM across 21 products.

Commenting on Balaji Srinivasan's estimations, tech veteran and former Phunware CEO Alan Knitowski noticed that Bitcoin (BTC) might surpass the internet in adoption impetus.

While Bitcoin (BTC) might already be growing faster than the internet, its adoption is near 1999 levels for Global Web, Knitowski's chart says.

Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Can 'Offset US Debt': CryptoQuant Founder,2024-12-21 09:41:00,BTC/USD,"U.Today - Ki Young Ju, CryptoQuant founder, says it is possible for the United States to strategically accumulate Bitcoin (BTC) to address a portion of its debt. He stated this in a post on X as part of the ongoing debate among cryptocurrency analysts and financial experts.



He explains that this could then be utilized to offset 36% of its domestically held debt. This would translate to clearing 70% of the total U.S. debt. Young Ju’s plan focuses primarily on settling domestic creditors. Perhaps he assumes that foreign creditors may not accept Bitcoin as payment.

Notably, Young Ju has relied on Bitcoin’s impressive growth rate over the past 15 years. BTC has recorded significant capital inflows and has recently seen its market capitalization soar above $2 trillion.

Young Ju suggests that if the U.S. government designates Bitcoin as a strategic asset like gold, it could positively impact its status. Notably, Bitcoin could gain equal status and official credibility as a store of value with gold.



Additionally, given its susceptibility to speculative pump, Bitcoin’s volatility could prove challenging. This might make it unappealing to creditors.

Despite these hurdles, the analyst believes that if the U.S. government establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, it will signal its confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. This could ultimately encourage broader market acceptance and push BTC into a more active role in global finance.

Meanwhile, per an earlier U.Today report, Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari believes Bitcoin has ""little"" practical use. However, Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy holds an opposing view.

$818 Million in Bitcoin (BTC) Change Unknown Hands,2024-12-22 07:37:00,BTC/USD,"U.Today - The calm of Sunday morning was shattered today by a sudden massive Bitcoin (BTC) shift. According to a report by Whales Alert, 8,427 BTC, equivalent to $818.69 million, were shifted between two unknown wallets.

If the recipient's wallet under the address ""bc1q5x"" is indeed unknown and has never been used, the sender's wallet has some links that may reveal the real owner behind it. As Arkham Intelligence's data shows, the address ""bc1qe9"" has previous ties to alleged Fortress Trust — a major custodian.

Interestingly, the company was on the verge of being acquired by Ripple last year, but the deal was called off. Whether this colossal amount of Bitcoin belongs to Fortress Trust or their former client is unknown. What is known is that such large transfers always have a ripple effect on the market and its participants.

Big moves like this don't usually go unnoticed, and for good reason. They tend to cause major market swings, especially on days when there's not a lot of trading activity. When there's less liquidity, even just the possibility of a follow-up move can make things more volatile.

When you see a transfer this big, especially outside of centralized exchanges, it's got to be more than just your everyday trading.

The implications? It is not something you can just ignore. These transfers are rarely just random. They are probably a sign of something bigger, like a strategic move, a change in the way big institutions are working together, or maybe even a new push into the market.

"XRP Hits Strong Support Level, Is $93,000 Next for Bitcoin (BTC)? Dogecoin (DOGE) Dream of $1 Is Over?",2024-12-22 19:01:00,"BTC/USD, XRP/USD, DOGE/USD","U.Today - At this crucial point, XRP is testing the 26 EMA, a key support level that could dictate the asset's short-term course. After weeks of erratic price action, XRP is now at a critical juncture trading close to $2.28. A base for future rallies, the 26 EMA has historically served as a dynamic support level during XRP's bullish trends.

Its function in the present market environment is identical as XRP exhibits stabilizing characteristics following a significant decline. Because it symbolizes the equilibrium between short-term market sentiment and long-term momentum, this level is especially significant. With XRP possibly aiming to retest the recent highs near $2.60, a bounce from the 26 EMA could pave the way for a recovery.

Nonetheless, the likelihood of a breakthrough is largely dependent on ongoing purchasing pressure and general market dynamics. Regaining higher levels and establishing a more robust uptrend are possible if XRP keeps up its pace and steers clear of additional bearish momentum.

XRP may be subject to more severe corrections if the 26 EMA is not held, possibly aiming for the next support at $2.15 or below. The market appears to be waiting for a clear move as volume analysis indicates a reasonably balanced trading environment. Since the RSI is currently close to neutral territory, neither overbought nor oversold conditions are indicated.

This gives XRP space to either rally or continue to consolidate before taking firm action. Traders will be keeping a close eye on XRP's performance at the 26 EMA moving forward. In contrast to a breakdown that might prompt greater caution, a robust bounce could restore trust in the asset's bullish narrative. Investors should keep an eye on market sentiment and volume trends as XRP moves through this crucial stage.



This action has drawn attention to Bitcoin's next support level, which is approximately $93,000. The 50 EMA is a crucial technical indicator that frequently acts as a dynamic support level during corrective phases, and this area corresponds with it. Selling activity has increased as a result of the market's sentiment being dampened by the inability to sustain $100,000.

The increasing volume that accompanies the price drop supports the bearish thesis even more and raises the prospect of a more significant correction soon. The 100 EMA and 200 EMA or $83,000 and $74,000, respectively, would be the next crucial levels to keep an eye on if Bitcoin is unable to find solid support at $93,000.

However, there is still potential for a recovery because the RSI is still above oversold territory. Bitcoin would have to reclaim $100,000 though in order to restore market trust and its bullish momentum. The direction of the Bitcoin market is also greatly influenced by the larger market.

Bitcoin's future actions are probably going to be strongly correlated with the state of the market as a whole given the macroeconomic uncertainties and the declining volume in the cryptocurrency space. All eyes are currently on the $93,000 mark. While a breach could increase selling pressure, a strong defense of this support could open the door for a recovery.



The 50 EMA is serving as a brittle support at $0.28, and the price chart shows that DOGE is having difficulty maintaining momentum above important levels. Further losses might be possible if this level is broken, which might push DOGE in the direction of the next support level at $0.22. This area, which corresponds to the 100 EMA, offers the asset a substantial buffer against escalating bearish pressure.

DOGE is up against a difficult climb on the resistance side. The $0.38 level, where buyers have historically had difficulty gaining traction, stands out as a significant obstacle. Although a clear break above this resistance might indicate a recovery, the general mood and state of the market indicate that this might not be possible in the near future. The recent sell-off has seen a spike in trading volume, which suggests strong bearish activity and contributes to the bearish outlook.

Despite not showing any indications of reversing the current trend, the RSI is still in the neutral zone. It must stabilize above the 50 EMA and launch a robust recovery toward $0.38 and higher if DOGE is to regain its upward momentum and bring back the $1 dream. The possibility of additional corrections remains high until then, making investors cautious about the asset's short-term outlook.

'Rich Dad Poor Dad' Author Kiyosaki Reveals His Plan to Get Rich Amid Global Crash,2024-12-23 05:10:00,"GC, SI, BTC/USD","U.Today - The wheels of a global financial crash, says Robert Kiyosaki, are already in motion. It is no longer distant speculation but, as he describes, a reality unfolding across multiple continents. From Europe to China to the United States, major economic players are grappling with what he sees as the makings of a severe downturn. Depression ahead? It is a question Kiyosaki raises, urging individuals to prepare wisely.

Kiyosaki’s advice is straightforward: be responsible with money, hold tightly to your job and rethink your financial habits. This is not simply a call to economize but a broader critique of systemic shortcomings.

To him, the real culprits are not just market forces but leadership failures and educational gaps. Schools, as Kiyosaki often asserts, leave individuals woefully unprepared for managing money — a glaring deficiency in today’s uncertain times.

There is no ambiguity in his preferred safeguards. Gold, silver and Bitcoin (BTC) stand at the center of Kiyosaki’s financial playbook, assets he considers resilient in the face of crises. Interestingly, his evolving view of Bitcoin reflects a broader shift.

Once skeptical, dismissing it as mere speculation, Kiyosaki now embraces the cryptocurrency, referring to it as the ""people’s money."" And with no shortage of confidence, he anticipates its value could soar to $350,000 as early as next year.



But Kiyosaki’s warning is not just about bracing for impact. Crises, he notes, also create opportunities. The potential for wealth-building exists, even in downturns, if one is informed and prepared.

It is not merely a matter of survival but of rethinking strategies, learning and positioning oneself to thrive. In his view, financial literacy is the cornerstone — a lesson he believes everyone should take seriously, now more than ever.

US crypto industry eyes possible day-one Trump executive orders,2024-12-23 06:10:00,BTC/USD,"By Hannah Lang

(Reuters) - The cryptocurrency industry is pushing President-elect Donald Trump's team to kick start his promised crypto policy overhaul when he takes office next month with executive orders that would help push tokens mainstream, according to industry officials.

Trump plans to issue a flurry of executive orders and directives on everything from immigration to energy on his first day in office on Jan. 20, Reuters reported this month.

On the campaign trail, Trump courted crypto cash with promises to be a ""crypto president,"" and the industry wants him to make good on that pledge with executive orders creating a bitcoin stockpile, ensuring the industry can access banking services, and creating a crypto council, the people said.

They are pushing for those executive orders within Trump's first 100 days in office, and expect at least one could come on Jan. 20, said two other people with knowledge of the matter.

""Given the tenor of the campaign, it would be imperative for executive orders to really set out what the actual priorities will be on day one and provide some kind of roadmap,"" said Rebecca Rettig, chief legal and policy officer at crypto company Polygon Labs.

Worried about crime and volatility, President Joe Biden's regulators cracked down on crypto companies, but Trump has pledged to reverse course. His crypto policy team is already taking shape, with the announcement this month of crypto-friendly Securities and Exchange Commission chair Paul Atkins and White House crypto czar David Sacks.

""There has been an effort in the Washington bureaucratic swamp to stifle innovation... but President Trump will deliver on his promise to encourage American leadership in crypto,"" Trump transition team spokesperson Brian Hughes said in a statement.

Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, hit new records above $107,000 this month after Trump reiterated his plan, first unveiled in a speech in July, for a strategic bitcoin reserve. Bitcoin has since fallen back below $100,000.

Analysts are divided on whether Trump could use executive powers to create the reserve, potentially via the Treasury Department, or whether an act of Congress would be necessary.

One industry group, the Bitcoin Policy Institute, has gone as far as to draft a text of a potential executive order Trump could use to establish such a stockpile.

That draft would designate bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset and require the Treasury Secretary to spend $21 billion over a year to amass a national bitcoin stockpile, according to the draft seen by Reuters.

Zack Shapiro, the Bitcoin Policy Institute's head of policy, said the United States should get ahead of geopolitical rivals in monetizing bitcoin, ""rather than have the price run up without the United States having any reserves."" He declined to say if the group had shared the draft with Trump's team.

Trump also said in July that he would not let banks ""choke"" crypto firms out of the traditional financial system, and some executives expect he will also try to address that issue with an executive order. Crypto companies have long complained that banks won't work with them due to regulatory scrutiny, although regulators say banks are free to lend to crypto firms that follow the law.

While an executive order directing bank regulators to go easy on crypto would send a signal to agency officials and provide them with political cover, it's unlikely to have legal force since federal bank regulators are independent, some executives warned.

""(They) are not going to change policy on the ground on day one,"" said Jonah Krane, partner at financial firm Klaros Group. ""But they will tell you what direction this administration wants to head.""

Trump has also said he'll create a crypto industry council and his team is discussing how to structure and staff it. Previous administrations have stood up specialized councils via executive orders, executives noted.



More broadly, Trump could also try to address crypto complaints that existing regulations are not fit for the industry with an executive order articulating core principles for crypto regulation, similar to an order Trump issued in 2017 directing regulators to review banking rules.

""I wouldn't be surprised if you get something like an executive order early on that directs the agencies to re-examine their rules in this space,"" Krane added.

"Just in: MicroStrategy Buys $561 Million More Bitcoin (BTC), Announces Saylor",2024-12-23 09:00:00,"MSTR, BTC/USD","U.Today - MicroStrategy has made headlines again by purchasing 5,262 BTC for approximately $561 million at an average price of $106,662 per BTC. The company now holds a staggering 444,262 BTC, accumulated at a total cost of approximately $27.7 billion, with an average purchase price of $62,257 per BTC.

Despite impressive returns of 47.4% since the beginning of the quarter and 73.7% since the beginning of the year, skepticism about the company's strategy is growing.

It is believed that to sustain its purchases, MicroStrategy raises capital through methods such as issuing convertible and corporate bonds, securing credit lines and selling shares.

This cycle appears to operate as follows: shares are sold to acquire the cryptocurrency, and the rising price per BTC increases asset value, enabling further loans, which are then reinvested in more Bitcoin purchases.

Some observers warn that a significant decline in Bitcoin's price or MicroStrategy's stock could trigger a cascade effect. A sharp fall in MSTR shares would weaken the collateral backing its loans, potentially leading to forced asset sales, including BTC.

This scenario could exert downward pressure on the broader cryptocurrency market, as the company holds 2.2% of the global Bitcoin supply now.

Thus, while some view Michael Saylor’s approach as a bold bid to cement the cryptocurrency's role in the financial system, others see it as unsustainable. History offers a cautionary note: in 2000, MSTR shares surged to $333 before plummeting 99%, a collapse that took 24 years to recover from.

AdEx AURA redefines how Web3 platforms interact with users by embedding personalized recommendations directly into wallets, apps, and blockchain explorers. For example, wallets can use AURA to dynamically organize app catalogs, prioritizing user-relevant options and paid placements that add value. On swap and bridge pages, AURA enables context-aware suggestions tailored to users’ transaction history, while blockchain explorers can leverage transaction patterns to suggest meaningful next steps. This approach creates a seamless user experience, helping marketers and business developers engage with their audiences more effectively while fostering a fair attention economy.

The native ADX token plays a key role in AURA’s ecosystem. Marketers and business developers can stake ADX to prioritize their recommendations or expedite placement approvals, contributing to a safer, scam-resistant environment.

Huge Bitcoin Reverse Explained by Bloomberg’s Mike McGlone: Details,2024-12-23 10:25:00,"US500, BTC/USD","U.Today - Bloomberg’s chief commodity strategist Mike McGlone has taken to his account on the X social media network to reveal to the crypto community why the Bitcoin price has reversed and gone down way below not only its recent $108,268 all-time high but dropped even lower and is trading below $94,000 at the moment.



The analyst pointed out that unlike Bitcoin, the S&P 500 index has not seen any major drawdown in the fourth quarter this year, while BTC is trading roughly 3x the volatility of beta. Still, McGlone added, S&P 500’s remarkable strength that is being shown so far will not necessarily hold next year, according to the tweet: “That the S&P 500 hasn't had a 10% drawdown since 4Q23 is unlikely to be sustained in 2025.”

As for the current big Bitcoin drawdown, aside from the volatility, McGlone called the main reason for that to be “Just a bit of normal reversion.” Today, Bitcoin has declined by 2.45%, falling from $96,275 to $93,660. During the last week, the world’s flagship cryptocurrency has shed approximately 14% as it collapsed from above $108,300 to the above-mentioned price level where it is changing hands at the moment.



He stated that the global crash of economies and financial markets, which he predicted multiple times earlier, has started and what lies ahead might be another Great Depression. He advised that his readers on the X platform should be smarter with their money and hold on to their jobs and sources of income.

However, he pointed out that regardless of which path any economy in the world (but particularly the US one) takes, “gold, silver, and Bitcoin hold their value.” Kiyosaki also reminded the community his favorite thesis about making a fortune and opportunities during market crises: “For many people crashes are the best times to get rich.”

"Michael Saylor's Latest Bitcoin Bet Down by $62 Million, Will It Recover?",2024-12-23 11:23:00,"MSTR, BTC/USD","U.Today - MicroStrategy, the business intelligence firm whose appetite for Bitcoin (BTC) remains insatiable, recently bought more BTC. The purchase, which cost the firm approximately $561 million for 5,262 BTC, was made at an average price of $106,662 per BTC.



As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $94,238.21, up by 1.52% in the last 24 hours. Despite its trading volume surging by 34.12% to $54.58 billion, investors’ confidence has not impacted the price.

This slump in Bitcoin’s price has set MicroStrategy back by over $65 million from its last purchase alone. At BTC’s current rate of $94,238, MicroStrategy has suffered a loss of $65,375,088.

This is significant given that MicroStrategy is always ahead, with huge profit margins in previous purchases. As this stands, unless Bitcoin rebounds quickly enough, MicroStrategy could have a lot of loss to deal with.



Therefore, for MicroStrategy to meet its obligations to investors who bought these convertible notes, the price of Bitcoin must stay up. Primarily, a slump in price could trigger panic, causing its shares and MSTR to plunge as well. This development could negatively affect MicroStrategy’s capital base.

Additionally, as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, which has about 2.2% of the total supply, MicroStrategy’s actions could tremendously impact the asset's price outlook.

Analysts insist that given the pending change of administration in the U.S. by Jan. 20, 2025, bullish sentiment could support Bitcoin on its price recovery path. How this unfolds, only time will tell.

"Bitcoin to Hit $250,000? Here Are 2025 Market Predictions",2024-12-23 11:33:00,"MSTR, BTC/USD, USDT/USD","U.Today - The year 2024 was a landmark year for crypto, with the approval of the Bitcoin spot ETFs in the U.S. and the subsequent introduction of Ethereum ETFs, as well as several cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, reaching new record highs.

Bitcoin has been on a tear in 2024, up 145% year to date and reaching a record high of $108,268 on Dec. 17. Other cryptocurrencies, such as Solana, BNB and PEPE, followed suit, reaching fresh all-time highs.

As Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies rose to new all-time highs, demand for Tether's USDT stablecoin — pegged to the dollar — has skyrocketed. The token's market valuation increased by about $50 billion this year, reaching more than $140 billion.

In a historic milestone, MicroStrategy has become the first Bitcoin holding company to enter the Nasdaq-100. The Bitcoin treasury company intends to raise $42 billion in capital over the next three years through at-the-market stock sales and convertible debt issues to buy more Bitcoin.



According to a recent market prediction published by CoinGecko, Bitcoin’s growth trajectory appears promising given 2024's momentum and the anticipated key events of 2025. An optimistic projection sees Bitcoin skyrocketing 154% in value, and in this scenario, Bitcoin might reach a price of $250,000.

Other Bitcoin projections for 2025 include Fundstrat's Tom Lee, who is very positive about Bitcoin for next year. According to Lee, Bitcoin might increase in 2025 to reach $250,000. Bitcoin has two tailwinds heading into the new year, one of which is the cryptocurrency's halving price cycle, which is often bullish for the price of Bitcoin in the year after a halving event.

Bitwise, a Bitcoin ETF producer, shares the same upbeat outlook, predicting that 2025 may herald the start of crypto's golden period, given the historic year of 2024. One of the ten forecasts made was that Bitcoin may trade above $200,000.

K-Culture Meme Coin Pepe Buldak Surpasses $2 Million in Presale,2024-12-24 02:05:00,,"Seoul, Korea, December 24th, 2024, Chainwire

Inspired by the popular Korean spicy chicken dish ""Buldak,"" Pepe Buldak ($BUL) introduces a unique concept that merges the global appeal of memes with elements of Korean culture. By leveraging the recognition of ""Buldak"" and combining it with the viral appeal of the ""Pepe"" meme coin, the project has drawn attention worldwide, raising over $2 million during its presale phase and gaining traction across Korea, Asia, and other regions.

Highlighting Korean Cuisine and Culture

While ""Buldak"" is widely associated with instant noodles, its origin as a traditional spicy chicken dish is less well known internationally. Pepe Buldak seeks to spotlight this culinary tradition through an innovative platform called ""Open Franchise."" This decentralized franchise model aims to promote Korean dishes and cultural elements globally through a community-driven framework.



Pepe Buldak combines Web3 innovation with a real-world utility framework, incorporating features such as automatic staking, enhanced presale rewards, instant token claims, and a gamified experience through its ""Shiba Gimbap NFT."" The ""Open Franchise"" model allows participants to establish franchise operations by staking $BUL tokens. This approach represents a novel integration of digital assets with offline businesses, positioning the project as a first-of-its-kind initiative in the meme coin sector.

To support its tokenomics, $BUL employs a deflationary model to create long-term value. Franchise operations require staking a minimum of 100 million tokens, which contributes to increased scarcity as the network expands. The project has also completed smart contract audits by Germany’s SolidProof and the Netherlands’ Coinsult, reinforcing its security and transparency.

Cultural Integration and Global Outreach

Pepe Buldak draws inspiration from widely recognized elements of Korean culture, such as K-pop, iconic TV dramas, and viral social media trends, to create engaging campaigns for international audiences. By blending these cultural references with its meme coin concept, the project highlights the global appeal of Korean culture and its potential to influence the Web3 ecosystem.

A Pioneering K-Meme Initiative

As the meme coin trend continues to grow in Korea, Pepe Buldak distinguishes itself with a decentralized model and cultural integration. With no significant K-Meme presence dominating the market, Pepe Buldak aims to position itself as a pioneering example of a Korean meme coin gaining global recognition.

About Pepe Buldak

Pepe Buldak is the newest project entering the K-meme phenomenon through the Web3 sector. As a result of the recent rise in the popularity of everything Korean, Pepe Buldak is quickly rising to fame. The team seeks to solve problems from traditional franchise businesses through its “Open Franchise” solution.

The presale is live on the project’s website, and the $BUL token price steadily increases phase after phase. By the time the token goes live, the early investors will be able to collect their tokens by connecting wallets and clicking “claim.”

For $BUL, the total supply determined by the team is only 4.2 trillion tokens. Memecoin fans will notice that this number represents a small 1% of the originally issued Pepe tokens (420 trillion).

Token distribution will be as follows: 50% on DEX/CEX liquidity, 20% through mining, and 30% for community rewards over time. The Pepe Buldak team has zero token allocations. This feature may reduce the likelihood of dumping and allow for a more stable market for $BUL.

Anyone interested in Pepe Buldak can visit its official website for more information and to participate in the ongoing presale. The social media pages below provide the latest developments and news on Pepe Buldak.

'Rich Dad Poor Dad' Author Kiyosaki Debunks Bitcoin Price FUD,2024-12-24 08:39:00,BTC/USD,"U.Today - The price of Bitcoin (BTC) continues to fall, losing nearly 15% in just six days, which is quite painful for a $2 trillion asset. Of course, such a performance changes the sentiment of crypto market participants from bullish euphoria to fear, uncertainty and doubt.

At the same time, Robert Kiyosaki, renowned author of best-selling book ""Rich Dad Poor Dad,"" is not worried about the recent drop in Bitcoin's price.

He sees opportunity where others see loss. For him, it is not a time to be down but a time to take action. He believes that market corrections are a great time to buy more Bitcoin at lower prices. He says that investors often overreact and focus too much on short-term price movements.

Kiyosaki has been a major proponent of Bitcoin for a long time and sees it as a game-changing financial tool. He loves its decentralized nature and calls it the ""people's money,"" saying that its design makes it accessible to anyone willing to take the first step.

Unlike traditional assets, BTC does not require investors to commit large sums of money. Small purchases, even satoshis, are a great way to get started, which the author thinks is brilliant.



To Kiyosaki, the recent price drop is not a setback for Bitcoin; it is a signal to reprioritize and seize the opportunities that such market movements present.

"$2,200,000 Per Bitcoin – Max Keiser Predicts",2024-12-24 09:07:00,BTC/USD,"U.Today - Prominent Bitcoin maximalist and former financial journalist Max Keiser has voiced a new ultra-bullish Bitcoin price prediction based on newly emerged data. Now, he believes BTC is likely to soar as high as $2,200,000 per coin in the long term.

Keiser commented on a tweet published by a Bitcoin enthusiast on the X platform related to Bitcoin holdings of various countries, including El Salvador, where Keiser lives and where he holds the position of El Salvador president Nayib Bukele’s Bitcoin advisor.



The author of the X post presumed that if “all or many major countries start bidding,” he expects the price of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, to skyrocket “over the coming 12 to 24 months” if countries around the world begin accumulating BTC actively. He then thanked Max Keiser for the pleasure of following him.

Max Keiser responded that in that case, Bitcoin is likely to soar to $2,200,000 per coin. That is 10x than his previous stable BTC prediction - $220,000.

In an earlier tweet, he stressed the importance of the newly elected U.S. leader forming a strategic Bitcoin Reserve.



The financial expert reckons that rather than doing that, it would be much more productive to “be grateful and buy more Bitcoin.”

Unlike Max Keiser, Kiyosaki does not make such ultra-bullish Bitcoin price outlooks. However, last week, Kiyosaki predicted that he expects the digital gold to head for $350,000 next year.

Bitcoin Countdown: Less Than 1.2 Million BTC Left to Mine,2024-12-24 09:58:00,"BTC/USD, USDT/USD, COIN","U.Today - The clock is ticking on Bitcoin's total supply. According to Bitcoin historian Pete Rizzo, there are now officially less than 1.2 million BTC left to be mined. Rizzo’s observation highlights Bitcoin's defining feature — its scarcity, which is a key factor in its value proposition. As the supply dwindles, the potential for increased demand could drive its price higher.

Bitcoin's total supply is capped at 21 million coins, a design set by its pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. With 19.8 million BTC already mined, the remaining 1.2 million represents less than 6% of the total supply.

The Bitcoin halving event, which occurs every four years, reduces the already limited supply even more. During a halving, the reward for mining new blocks is reduced by half, slowing the rate at which new Bitcoins enter circulation.

The next Bitcoin halving is projected to occur on April 17, 2028, at a block height of 1,050,000. When this happens, the Bitcoin block reward will be slashed to 1.5625. The last Bitcoin halving occurred on April 20, 2024, at block height 840,000, with the Bitcoin block reward halved from 6.25 to 3.125.

With less than 1.2 million BTC left to mine, experts predict that the last Bitcoin will be mined around 2140, based on the current pace of block production and the halving schedule. This long-term horizon guarantees that Bitcoin's scarcity will remain a distinguishing quality for decades to come.



However, in the past, this tendency has only lasted during bull markets, attracting new buyers who saw it as an opportunity.

Recent on-chain data, according to CryptoQuant, also reveals an interesting trend: although considerable amounts of Tether (USDT) are leaving exchanges, a large inflow of Bitcoin (BTC) has been detected entering exchanges. Furthermore, despite the recent dramatic price decline, spot markets are experiencing continued selling pressure.

This confluence of reasons suggests that Bitcoin's price could fall further in the immediate term. However, from a macroeconomic standpoint, there does not appear to be a catalyst for a sustained bearish trend following this short-term correction.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $94,856.

Michael Saylor Announces $299 Million 'Bitcoin Gift' to MSTR Holders,2024-12-24 10:10:00,"MSTR, BTC/USD","U.Today - Michael Saylor, founder of MicroStrategy business intelligence firm, who is currently its executive chairman in charge of its Bitcoin strategy, has taken to the X social media platform to reveal last week’s net benefit paid to the company’s BTC shareholders.

Saylor called it a Bitcoin “gift” to the company’s shareholders.



Thus, the MicroStrategy’s founder has stressed the company’s commitment to increasing shareholder value by means of strategic Bitcoin accumulation and yield-generation strategies. The company’s strong treasury management and its strategy focused on Bitcoin as a store-of-value have earned it a leading position among publicly traded companies that are embracing Bitcoin.



As of now, Michael Saylor’s company holds a whopping 444,262 BTC valued at roughly $27.7 billion bought at $62,257 per BTC on average.

Earlier today, Saylor published a tweet, in which he defended his company’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy, saying that if you do not buy BTC at the top, you “leave money on the table.”

"No, MicroStrategy Not Selling 10 Billion Shares to Buy Bitcoin",2024-12-24 10:49:00,MSTR,"U.Today - MicroStrategy (MSTR), the business intelligence firm, is in the news again. This time, there are speculations that the Michael Saylor-led firm plans to issue 10 billion MSTR shares to purchase an additional $3 trillion worth of Bitcoin (BTC).



Primarily, the figure is staggeringly huge. To Park, it sounds absurd for a company to invest $3 trillion into an asset. Interestingly, the total market capitalization of Bitcoin currently at the market price is less than $2 trillion. Hence, pulling such a move would be almost impossible, as MicroStrategy is worth about $85 billion.

Beyond the surface, Park also addressed critical issues among some potential investors holding back from MSTR due to the price fluctuations of BTC. He referenced a previous post explaining the fears around MSTR and its price performance relative to the crypto market.



However, he assured readers that even if Bitcoin plummets to a record low of $30,000, MSTR will still not crash to zero.

Park highlighted that MicroStrategy has multiple capital extension strategies and additional levers to win in the broader market. This aligns with a U.Today report, where Adam Back, Blockstream CEO, maintains that MicroStrategy’s shares are cheap, believing they are undervalued.

Furthermore, Park maintains that investors need to avoid being bearish with MSTR every time the price of Bitcoin drops. As of this writing, the BTC price was trading up by 3.95% at $97,548 in a surprising market rebound.

"XRP's Flag Pattern: What to Expect? Dogecoin (DOGE) Reaches Equilibrium, Bitcoin (BTC) Critical Support Level Reached",2024-12-24 19:01:00,"BTC/USD, XRP/USD, DOGE/USD","U.Today - The XRP chart shows a descending flag pattern, indicating that the asset has entered a critical phase. A possible decline is frequently indicated by this bearish continuation pattern. The 26 EMA, which has historically served as a turning point for the asset, is currently where XRP is trading, though, and it gives some hope for stabilization or even a possible rebound.

Declining highs and lows within a narrow channel are characteristics of the descending flag. The steadily declining trading volume during this phase is a positive indicator despite the fact that it may appear concerning. When volume decreases and prices fall, it usually indicates that there is not much selling pressure.

This could indicate that consolidation rather than a long-term bearish trend is driving the downward movement. The 26 EMA is a significant support level for XRP, and any bullish recovery depends on its ability to stay above it. A recovery from this level might cause XRP to return to testing resistance at $2.40. If this level is broken, it may open the door for a move toward the $2.60-$2.80 range, which is home to more resistance.

On the other hand, if the 26 EMA is not maintained as support, XRP may test lower. The 50 ,which is at $1.69, may be revisited in the event of a breakdown. Selling pressure may increase if this occurs because market sentiment may turn even more bearish. Investors should closely monitor the flag pattern's breakout direction.

It could be the beginning of a new rally if XRP can break higher with more volume. In the midst of the consolidation, the declining volume trend provides some hope that XRP may be preparing for its next significant move. While the market awaits confirmation, patience and prudence are still crucial.



DOGE is currently trading at about $0.32 on the price chart, which has offered short-term support but is not likely to hold in the long run. The 50 EMA has already been broken, indicating that the bullish momentum is waning. If selling pressure increases the 100 EMA, which is located at about $0.283, could serve as a safety net. DOGE's price does not currently have the upward momentum required for a proper recovery.

Since speculative interest in meme coins has decreased, the general sentiment of the market is also not providing much support. The price might attract buyers seeking a bargain if it falls any lower to the 100 EMA, which might lead to a bounce. But if the 100 EMA is broken, there may be a more severe drop toward the 200 EMA at $0.212. Key resistance levels should be monitored by investors who anticipate a recovery.

A move back toward $0.40 or higher could be facilitated by a breakout above $0.35, which would rekindle bullish momentum. However, a broad market rally and significant buying interest are necessary for such a reversal, and these seem less likely in the current climate. The short-term path of least resistance for DOGE is probably going to be downward. Investors should prepare for additional declines before any significant reversal occurs, even though a recovery is feasible. As DOGE manages this delicate balance for the time being, patience and vigilance are essential.



Although this level frequently serves as a launching pad for reversals, bullish periods have traditionally ended when it has been breached. The early 2024 rally may go down as one of the weakest in Bitcoin's history, with gains of only about 60% from its previous all-time high if the cryptocurrency is unable to maintain this support. This performance is rather disappointing for a cryptocurrency that has seen exponential growth in the past.

Notwithstanding these worries, Bitcoin's drop to the 50 EMA does not necessarily mean that its upward trend will come to an end. A recovery from this point might boost self-esteem and even spark a new rally. To make sure the market keeps moving higher, bulls will be looking for a robust recovery above the psychological $100,000 threshold.

Conversely, Bitcoin may test lower levels like the 200 EMA around $75,000 if it continues to decline below the 50 EMA. In addition to signaling the end of the current bull run, this would also set a negative tone for the upcoming months. When compared to more conventional assets, a 60% gain is still impressive, even though it may seem small for Bitcoin.

Economist Declares 'Santa Rally' on Bitcoin,2024-12-25 03:39:00,BTC/USD,"U.Today - Crypto enthusiasts have also embraced the idea of a Santa Rally; it is not just a concept found on traditional markets. Essentially, it describes an increase in asset prices in late December that is frequently driven by optimism, lower trading volumes and positive sentiment during the holidays.

Although erratic, this phenomenon has been noted in the historical performance of Bitcoin in December. Alex Kruger, an economist, recently emphasized this trend when he declared the Santa Rally is finally here.

The recent recovery of Bitcoin's price following a decline to the 50 EMA appears to support his assertion. Because of the stability of this support level, which is around $94,500, Bitcoin has been able to recover toward $98,000, rekindling expectations for a higher year-end. At the moment, the Bitcoin chart shows a possible change in momentum. Bitcoin has increased in proximity to the psychological $100,000 threshold after plunging to a crucial support level. But things are not quite going smoothly yet.

The modest volume that has accompanied the upward move thus far indicates that, in the absence of more robust buying pressure, the rally may lose momentum. Regaining the $100,000 mark would be a huge psychological victory for Bitcoin if it keeps rising, possibly paving the way for future gains.

However, if the price does not rise above $100,000, there may be consolidation or even a retest of the $94,500 support. Should that level be broken, Bitcoin may move toward the next significant support level, which is $85,000. There is a surge of optimism following the Santa Rally, but traders should exercise caution.

Although a wider bullish phase may begin with the rally, cautious expectations are advised due to the lack of strong volume and ongoing market uncertainties. The resilience of Bitcoin at critical levels gives some hope for the time being, but whether or not this holiday cheer has enduring momentum will be determined over the coming days.

XRP Rally Pauses — Is Bitcoin Breakout Next?,2024-12-25 10:51:00,"BTC/USD, XRP/USD","U.Today - XRP’s recent rally has come to a halt after achieving highs near $3, leaving the market wondering what happens next. Amid the current uncertainty on the crypto market, XRP appears to be consolidating, particularly in its Bitcoin trading pair. Could a breakout against BTC be on the horizon?

Over the past few weeks, XRP has been a standout performer, gaining traction amid positive developments in the broader crypto market and positive sentiment around the Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin launch.

XRP rose to highs of $2.90 on Dec. 3, while also reaching highs of $0.00003 in its Bitcoin pairing, a level last seen in May 2021.

However, after this feat, the rally seems to have entered a cooling-off phase. The XRP/BTC trading pair, which assesses XRP's relative strength to Bitcoin, has slowed and settled into a range, signaling that the next move could be pivotal.

Traders are eyeing the $0.0000265 and 0.00003 BTC levels as significant barriers for XRP. A breakthrough above these key levels could signal the next leg of the rally.

XRP’s rally may have paused, but the market is on the lookout for a clear direction on where it trends next. Whether XRP breaks out or declines, its next moves might shape its trajectory in the short term.



The recent price action has created a symmetrical triangle pattern, which is often regarded as a continuation pattern but sometimes acts as a reversal pattern. If the price rises and breaks above the triangle, the chances of a break above $2.91 increase.

A break and close below the triangle, on the other hand, may indicate that XRP has reached its short-term peak. Such a move might pull XRP to the 50-day SMA at $1.73.

Unidentified Whales Buy 240K-420K Bitcoins This Year: CryptoQuant CEO,2024-12-26 07:19:00,"MSTR, BTC/USD","U.Today - Ki Young Ju, crypto analyst, CEO and founder of the CryptoQuant on-chain data company, has taken to the X social media platform (widely known as Twitter in the past) to comment on whale transactions spotted recently, as whales have been buying tons of Bitcoin.

At the time of this writing, Bitcoin is changing hands at $95,772 after dropping by 3.6% over the last 24 hours. It was a sharp reversal after the Christmas rally witnessed on Dec. 25, when Bitcoin surged to $99,000 briefly.



He believes that this change in sentiment reflects the fact that retail investors are keeping away from Bitcoin and have left market domination to whales.

Right now, Ju says, the community is clearly witnessing a bull market as on-chain data demonstrates whales buying Bitcoin actively, with $7 billion in capital entering the market on a weekly basis.

The CryptoQuant CEO also shared an expectation that at the current bull market, even if Bitcoin should reverse and enter a correction, the price will hardly drop more than 30%, and such a drop would certainly be short-lived. After this potential correction, Bitcoin is likely to recover by more than 30%, per Ju.



Many institutions have been purchasing BTC from whales via privacy transactions, Ju revealed: “Whales frequently use privacy transactions to transfer their funds to new institutional investors.”

However, Ju admitted that there were certain transactions that his on-chain data company was unable to identify, therefore, those buyers remain undisclosed. They have bought between 240,000 BTC and 420,000 BTC: “We still don't know who has accumulated approx. 240K–420K BTC. Who are these whales?”

Christmas Is Over: Bitcoin (BTC) Loses $2 Trillion Market Cap,2024-12-26 08:29:00,BTC/USD,"U.Today - It is Dec. 26, the day after Christmas, and to put it mildly, the holiday spirit did not last long — for the cryptocurrency market in particular. As soon as the global holiday came to an end, the price of BTC began to fall, dropping as much as 4% during today's trading session.

As a result, quotes of the leading cryptocurrency hit $95,200, but what is more worrying is that the major figure of $2 trillion for the market capitalization of Bitcoin was lost. This is not the first time this has happened recently, but once again, it signals the weakness of major digital assets in the current market environment.

The reason may be that December is the end of the quarter, the end of the month and the end of the year. This is the time when traders and investors close their positions, say goodbye and return after the holidays.

Considering the fact that, this year, Bitcoin has become more correlated with traditional financial markets than ever before, first of all due to the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., the tendencies typical for the S&P 500, for example, will directly affect the cryptocurrency market.

In this case, the fact that Bitcoin is traded 24/7 with no days off does not seem to be an advantage, but rather the opposite.

Where the major cryptocurrency will find its local bottom remains to be seen. Recently, after reaching a new all-time high of $108,353 per BTC on Binance, the price of Bitcoin fell to a maximum of $92,300. There is also an open gap around $77,000 per BTC on the CME that has not closed after the events of November, which also serves as a worrying benchmark for crypto traders.

Max Keiser Reveals US Fate Amid Bitcoin Standard Adoption,2024-12-26 09:48:00,BTC/USD,"U.Today - Max Keiser, Bitcoin maximalist and former financial journalist, has advised the United States government. The recommendations come from macroeconomic factors and the global financial landscape.



Notably, it could lead to an erosion of confidence in the U.S. dollar as people seek an alternative to the once-dominant currency. Keiser explained that such a development could lead to a massive decline in the demand for U.S. dollar reserves.

The Bitcoin maximalist said this disadvantage will impact the United States due to its high debt burden. He says, "" Fiat  (BIT:STLAM) money imperialists die under a global Bitcoin standard.""

Keiser criticized the current monetary system, where the U.S. dollar is backed by trust and government policy rather than tangible assets like gold. Keiser’s reference to ""debt imperialism"" implies the U.S. could issue debt in dollars as a tool for economic control and global influence on other countries.



In the global space, Keiser considers Russia as being well positioned for a shift to Bitcoin standard. He believes Russia has a lesser national debt than the United States and other Western countries. This gives it an advantage, as it is less vulnerable to financial shocks.

Other factors that lean in Russia’s favor include the country’s abundant energy, which could support Bitcoin mining, which has become increasingly difficult. Additionally, Russia, a commodity-producing nation, has assets with intrinsic value, which aligns well with a Bitcoin-backed system.

"Michael Saylor Issues Bitcoin ‘Holiday Break’ Post, Hinting At Current BTC Drawdown",2024-12-26 11:02:00,"MSTR, BTC/USD","U.Today - Michael Saylor, the founder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy business intelligence giant, has issued what may be interpreted as a comment on today’s Bitcoin drawdown that coincided with the period of 2024 winter holidays.



Saylor published an AI-generated picture of himself sitting in front of a laptop with a “B”, meaning Bitcoin on it and a Christmas tree in the background. “Take a Holiday ₿reak,” MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin boss tweeted to his X followers.

As of now, as a result of the big Bitcoin price drawdown, the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization has lost roughly $2 trillion in value.



Still, even if this potential drop does happen indeed, Ju tweeted, it would be short-lived and Bitcoin would quickly regain more than 30% after the fall.

Ju tweeted that this year, many financial institutions and whales have been purchasing large amounts of Bitcoin by means of privacy transactions. Approximately 1.55 million Bitcoin has been bought this year in regular purchases, though – by spot Bitcoin ETFs and MicroStrategy.

Still, the CryptoQuant founder pointed out that $7 billion enters the market every week, therefore whales have been buying a lot. However, he admitted that CryptoQuant has been unable to identify whales who have bought between 240,000 and 420,000 Bitcoins this year using privacy transactions.

"Bitcoin (BTC) 'Santa Rally' Might Be Dangerous, XRP Critical But Stable, Dogecoin (DOGE) Volume Hints at Bearish Drop",2024-12-26 19:01:00,"BTC/USD, XRP/USD, DOGE/USD","U.Today - The so-called ""Santa Rally"" of Bitcoin, which is typically a time of optimism and price increases during the holiday season, is beginning to show indications of possible danger. After a brief decline below the 50 EMA at $95,000, Bitcoin has managed to recover and is currently trading close to $97,000. There is increasing concern that this rally may ultimately form a lower high, which is a traditional sign of a downtrend continuation.

A bearish pattern would be validated by a lower high, which might trigger a sharp decline in price. Bitcoin may find it difficult to sustain the positive momentum observed in previous months if it is unable to rise above prior highs of about $104,000. Bitcoin may move toward important support zones if it is unable to recover higher levels; the 100 EMA at about $84,500 is a crucial level to keep an eye on.

Rapid changes in sentiment and momentum for Bitcoin, which has been experiencing growing selling pressure in recent weeks, pose a threat. Despite the asset's attempts to rebound, volume indicators point to a mixed picture. Bitcoin's recent recovery might not last if this pattern continues, and investors hoping for more gains might fall into a trap.

This is consistent with the general ambiguity surrounding Bitcoin's future. If the market does not make a clear move above $100,000, it may be more susceptible to a more severe correction, with $84,500 and even $76,000 as possible targets.

Although the Santa Rally of Bitcoin may seem promising at first glance, traders and investors are finding it to be more and more risky. Given the potential for a lower high to form, this rally is crucial, and as the market moves through the holidays, prudence is encouraged. To rekindle bullish confidence, there must be a distinct breakout above resistance; otherwise, the downtrend might pick up more steam.



The persistent downward trend draws attention to the unpredictability of XRP's market conditions. When combined with declining trading volumes, the descending channel indicates that investors are reluctant to make a strong comeback to the market. If the general state of the market deteriorates, this lack of conviction makes XRP more susceptible to selling pressure.

XRP has been able to maintain a comparatively stable position close to its 26 EMA in spite of the dire short-term outlook. A sustained hold above this level could offer some respite for the asset, as it has historically served as a crucial support during volatile times. A break below this level, though, would probably quicken the decline and move XRP closer to the $1.80-$1.50 range, which is home to the 50 EMA and other historical supports.

The asset's general structure should also cause market participants to exercise caution. Concerns regarding XRP's medium-term prospects are raised by its failure to mount a robust recovery or break above significant resistance levels around $2.50. Reversing the bearish sentiment and restoring investor confidence require a successful breakout above this resistance.

At the moment, XRP's position is both crucial and vulnerable. The wider downtrend presents serious risks, even though the asset has demonstrated resilience close to its 26 EMA. A breach of the 1.80 level could indicate a more significant correction, so traders and investors should keep a careful eye on it. However, if stability is maintained above the 26 EMA, a slow recovery may be possible; however, significant buying pressure would be needed to change the trend.



DOGE has had difficulty breaking through important resistance levels, lingering at $0.34, without making any headway. The general downward trend that began following its surge to $0.48 has continued as a result of this stagnation. Because of the low trading activity, which indicates that market participants are reluctant to commit, DOGE is susceptible to additional declines. Still, there are some positive aspects to the muted volume.

In many instances, low volume during a downtrend can indicate the end of selling pressure. This could mean that bearish momentum is waning, which could lead to a reversal, or at least a brief retracement. Around $0.28, where the 100 EMA is located, Dogecoin may find support if bulls are able to intervene at this point. A recovery from this level might pave the way for one that goes higher — perhaps as high as $0.37.

"Bitcoin (BTC) Head and Shoulders Pattern to Cause Drop to $80,000? Possible Scenarios",2024-12-27 05:36:00,,"U.Today - Market analyst Aksel Kibar has offered a perceptive analysis of Bitcoin's possible course highlighting a price target of $80,000 in the event that particular chart patterns materialize. His research is predicated on a crucial pattern that the price of Bitcoin seems to be forming: a head and shoulders top that may influence the asset's future course. According to Kibar, this decline might be a retest of the broadening pattern that culminated in a breakout above $73,700 for Bitcoin.

In the recent Bitcoin rally, this level acted as a crucial threshold and the price surged above it to create a new range. The pullback is seen as a test of the validity of the breakout, and if the H&S formation keeps developing, $80,000 could be a potential downside target. The convergence of technical and behavioral indicators is the main conclusion of the analysis.

Kibar points out that the market community's knee-jerk and extremely confident replies frequently serve as markers of elevated speculative sentiment, which may trigger a correction. This behavioral observation is consistent with the historical trend of pullbacks following an initial breakout in broadening patterns.

According to the chart, in order to avoid a more significant retracement, key support levels like $91,000 and $87,000 must hold. Should these levels be broken, additional bearish pressure might be applied that could push the price as low as $80,000. On the other hand, a bounce above $100,000 would render the bearish H&S pattern meaningless and pave the way for a further upward bullish leg.

The future of Bitcoin is still in a precarious position. The $80,000 target is realistic in the H&S scenario, but whether Bitcoin can stabilize or face additional downward pressure will depend heavily on technical factors like key support and resistance levels, as well as overall market sentiment.

Bitcoin price today: falls for 4th session to $94K as post-election rally fades,,"MSTR, BTC/USD, XRP/USD, ETH/USD","Investing.com-- Bitcoin declined for the fourth consecutive day on Tuesday as a rally sparked by Donald Trump’s presidential election victory lost steam after the Federal Reserve turned hawkish last week.

Bitcoin fell 2.1% to $94,350.0 by 06:55 ET (11:55 GMT). It fell below the $93,000 level on Monday.

The token had fallen below the key $100,000 level last week after the Fed officials signaled a slower pace for future cuts. Bitcoin has declined for six out of the last seven days.

Bitcoin recorded its first weekly fall since Trump’s election win in early November, last week.

The rally had pushed prices to an all-time high of $108,244.9, after which prices fell due to profit-taking amid macroeconomic pressures induced by the Fed rate outlook.

The central bank lowered rates by 25 basis points but indicated only two rate cuts for the upcoming year, compared with previous expectations for four cuts.

This shift led investors to reassess their positions in speculative assets like Bitcoin, contributing to its price decline.

Crypto-related stocks fell on Monday tracking the downtrend in Bitcoin prices, which reached near the $92,000 level a day earlier.

MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) fell nearly 9%, while  Coinbase Global  Inc (NASDAQ:COIN) declined 4%. Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT)also ended lower on Monday.

MicroStrategy also came under added pressure after announcing a 1.3-million-stock sale to buy 5,262 bitcoins.

The most valuable Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA) dropped 3.6%.

Other cryptocurrencies were higher on Monday. Gains were limited as the demand for speculative assets was still subdued after the hawkish Fed rattled investor sentiment.

World no.2 crypto Ether was 2.2% higher at $3,408.93. Ether fell for several consecutive days since last week but has recovered slightly in the previous two days.

World no.3 crypto XRP rose 1.8% to $2.237.

Solana rose nearly 5% and Polygon jumped 5.5%, while Cardano added less than 1%. Among meme tokens, Dogecoin rose 2.2%.

Traders expect continued volatility in Bitcoin with a potential shift toward altcoins, as a significant options expiry influences market conditions in the upcoming holiday week.

“All eyes are on the massive expiry this Friday, where almost $20B notional across BTC and ETH options will expire,” QCP Capital said in a broadcast early Tuesday. “This represents almost half the total open interest (OI) on Deribit. We believe it's quite possible especially if spot continues to range here and as option sellers continue to roll their shorts out.”

""Rolling"" refers to traders extending their option positions by moving them to a later expiration date, rather than allowing them to expire. This strategy helps maintain the trade if they remain confident in their market outlook.

Elevated volatility can benefit option buyers by increasing the likelihood of the option becoming “in-the-money” – potentially generating profits before expiration.

“As BTC continues to struggle below 100k, we could also see alts start to play catch up again,” QCP noted, pointing out that a similar pattern emerged last month when bitcoin traded around current levels.

Bitcoin price today: drops for 3rd straight day below $96k on hawkish Fed outlook,,BTC/USD,"Investing.com-- Bitcoin fell notably on Friday, marking its third consecutive day of declines as macroeconomic pressures induced by the Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance and recent profit-taking amid record highs sparked an extended pullback.

Bitcoin fell 6% to $95,699.0 by 08:47 ET (14:47 GMT).

It fell below the $100,000 mark on Thursday after the Fed officials signaled a slower pace of rate cuts in 2025, with broader cryptocurrency markets also falling sharply.

The world's largest cryptocurrency hit an all-time high of $108,244.9 on Tuesday, after which prices tumbled on profit-taking and an uncertain macroeconomic outlook.

This sell-off further intensified after the Fed forecast just two more interest rate cuts in 2025, against previous expectations of four.

The central bank’s hawkish stance weighed on Bitcoin as tighter monetary policy reduces liquidity, making speculative assets like cryptocurrencies less attractive.

Moreover, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank has no intention of participating in any government initiative to stockpile substantial amounts of bitcoin.

This underscored growing doubts about a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, given the regulatory hurdles it is likely to face.

Incoming President Donald Trump had raised the prospect of a Bitcoin reserve, during an interview with CNBC last week.

The U.S. SEC has given the green light to filings from both the Nasdaq and the Cboe BZX Exchange to list and trade crypto index exchange-traded funds from Hashdex and Franklin Templeton.

The Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF and Franklin Crypto Index ETF will primarily hold spot bitcoin and spot ether, weighted roughly 80/20 in favor of bitcoin, based on their market capitalizations. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, these funds are expected to launch in January.

“Will be interesting to see if BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) or others attempt to piggyback on this and launch similar ETFs,” said Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store. “Regardless, I expect there will be meaningful demand for these products. Advisors LOVE diversification. Especially in an emerging asset class such as crypto.”

These approvals mark the first time crypto index ETFs have been authorized in the U.S.

El Salvador's government said on Thursday it will continue purchasing bitcoin, potentially at a faster rate, following a financing agreement with the International Monetary Fund.

The country’s President Nayib Bukele on Wednesday agreed to scale back Bitcoin's role in the El Salvador economy in return for a crucial $1.4 billion loan from the IMF. Bukele had in 2021 adopted Bitcoin as El Salvador's national currency, and had even planned to issue bonds backed by the country's Bitcoin holdings.

The IMF had advised the government to reduce its exposure to the cryptocurrency, with El Salvador's Bitcoin ambitions largely cutting it off from access to global debt markets.

Still, the country's Bitcoin stockpile has seen a large jump in valuation after the crypto's latest rally.

Other cryptocurrencies fell more sharply than Bitcoin, as traders assessed the Fed’s hawkish tilt. With several consecutive days of declines this week, most altcoins have lost all the hefty gains they recorded last week.

World no.2 crypto Ether slumped over 10% to $3,302.66. The token has fallen for four consecutive days.

World no.3 crypto XRP fell more than 7% to $2.19.

Solana fell 9.5% and Polygon slumped 11%, while Cardano fell more than 10% to $0.8609.

Among meme tokens, Dogecoin plunged 17% to $0.3015.

Bitcoin price today: dips below $96k as false TradingView chart spooks investors,,BTC/USD,"Investing.com-- Bitcoin dipped on Thursday, snapping two days of gains, as investors responded to a TradingView glitch and stayed cautious amid macroeconomic pressures following the U.S. Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance.

Bitcoin fell 2.6% weaker to $95,729.5 by 5:00 p.m. ET (22:00 GMT).

It fell below the key $100,000 mark last week after the Fed officials signaled a slower pace for future cuts.

Bitcoin pulled back on Thursday as markets seemingly responded to inaccurate chart data from TradingView.

The cryptocurrency dipped toward $95,000 after social media users flagged an anomaly on TradingView’s Bitcoin dominance chart, which incorrectly showed Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap dropping to 0%.

Although the error has been corrected, it reportedly triggered sudden trading reactions that pushed BTC/USD lower.

According to CoinGlass data, roughly $33 million in Bitcoin long positions were liquidated within four hours.

Bitcoin’s market dominance has become a key focus for traders recently, as Bitcoin’s climb to new all-time highs has left altcoins lagging.

Dominance briefly exceeded 61.5% in mid-November before pulling back, raising expectations for a potential “altseason.”

Bitcoin rose nearly 5% in the previous two sessions but failed to continue the positive momentum on Thursday as investors were cautious about the outlook for speculative assets like cryptocurrencies after the Fed indicated fewer interest rate cuts in 2025.

Last week, Bitcoin recorded its first weekly fall since Trump’s election win in early November after the Fed meeting stalled the post-election rally.

The rally had pushed prices to an all-time high of $108,244.9, after which prices fell due to profit-taking amid macroeconomic pressures induced by the Fed rate outlook.

The central bank lowered rates by 25 basis points but indicated only two rate cuts for the upcoming year, compared with previous expectations for four cuts.

This shift led investors to reassess their positions in speculative assets like Bitcoin, contributing to its price decline.

Russian companies have started using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for international payments after legislative changes allowed their use to help mitigate the impact of Western sanctions, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov stated on Wednesday.

Sanctions have made trade with key partners like China and Turkey more challenging, as local banks exercise extreme caution with Russia-related transactions to avoid attracting scrutiny from Western regulators.

In response, Russia legalized the use of cryptocurrencies in foreign trade this year and has initiated measures to regulate cryptocurrency mining, including Bitcoin. As a global leader in Bitcoin mining, the country is leveraging its position to navigate economic restrictions.

Other cryptocurrencies fell on Thursday, tracking Bitcoin's decline and as demand for speculative assets remained subdued after the hawkish Fed rattled investor sentiment.

World no.2 crypto Ether fell 4% to $3,336.75. Ether has gained in the last three sessions but has not been able to fully recover from last week's slump.

World no.3 crypto XRP fell 6% to $2.17.

Solana fell 3.6% and Polygon dropped 6.7%, while Cardano fell 5%. Among meme tokens, Dogecoin lost 6%.

Crypto markets could face elevated volatility in the final days of 2024 as a major Bitcoin options expiry approaches. On Friday at 8:00 UTC, 146,000 bitcoin options contracts worth nearly $14 billion will expire on Deribit, the largest event of its kind for the exchange. This represents 44% of all open BTC options and is expected to drive volatility.

Options give buyers the right to purchase or sell an asset at a set price in the future. Calls allow buying, while puts enable selling.

Alongside BTC, $3.84 billion in ETH options will also expire. ETH has fallen about 12% to $3,400 since the Fed meeting, with Deribit dominating over 80% of the global crypto options market.

Approximately $4 billion in BTC options, or 28% of the total $14 billion open interest, are set to expire ""in the money,"" delivering profits to holders. Traders may either close these positions or roll them into future contracts, potentially adding to market fluctuations.

"Bitcoin price today: retreats to $102k on hawkish Fed, Powell comments",,"BTC/USD, XRP/USD, ETH/USD, COIN","Investing.com-- Bitcoin slid lower on Thursday, retreating further from its recent peak as the U.S. Federal Reserve’s hawkish outlook raised concerns about tighter monetary conditions and eroded risk appetite.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell also said the central bank has no intention of participating in any government initiative to stockpile substantial amounts of Bitcoin, further dampening sentiment.

Bitcoin fell 2.2% to $102,340.0 by 09:26 ET (14:26 GMT). The crypto briefly fell below $100,000 during the session.

The world's largest cryptocurrency had hit an all-time high of $108,244.9 on Tuesday after incoming President Donald Trump further raised the prospect of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve last week.

The Fed reduced interest rates by 25 basis points but signaled it will adopt a slower pace for future cuts.

Policymakers were now seen supporting only two rate cuts in 2025, half of prior expectations for four, indicating a more cautious stance and a prolonged period of elevated borrowing costs.

The central bank’s hawkish stance weighed on Bitcoin as tighter monetary policy reduces liquidity, making speculative assets like cryptocurrencies less attractive.

Broader risk-driven assets also plummeted on this notion, with Wall Street logging steep declines on Wednesday.

Fed chief Powell said the central bank was not allowed to accumulate large amounts of Bitcoin, saying ""that's the kind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed.”

The response came while he was discussing the possibility of central bank involvement in the government's plan to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve after President-elect Donald Trump takes office.

While his comments do not have any direct bearing on the prospect for a Bitcoin reserve, they underscored growing doubts over whether the reserve will come into being, given the regulatory hurdles it is likely to face. Trump had outlined plans to build a reserve, but gave scant cues on how they would be carried out.

Elsewhere, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele agreed to scale back his plan to make Bitcoin a national currency in return for a crucial $1.4 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund.

The IMF deal marks a sharp pivot away from Bukele's Bitcoin ambitions, after he adopted the crypto in 2021 and even outlined plans to issue bonds backed by Bitcoin.

While El Salvador has since put these ambitions on ice, the country's Bitcoin stockpile has seen a large jump in valuation after the crypto's latest rally.

Ark Invest sold 13,780 Coinbase shares from its Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) on Wednesday, a transaction valued at $3.9 million. The sale followed a 10% drop in  Coinbase Global  Inc (NASDAQ:COIN) stock price after the Federal Reserve adopted a more hawkish tone.

This marks one of Cathie Wood's Ark's largest sales of Coinbase shares since it sold $2.8 million worth of the stock on September 23. The firm typically aims to prevent any single holding from exceeding 10% of an ETF’s portfolio.

As of December 18, Coinbase is the second-largest holding in ARKF, with a 9.9% weighting, narrowly trailing Spotify (NYSE:SPOT). The ETF’s Coinbase stake is currently valued at about $110 million. Overall, ARKF has gained approximately 54% year-to-date.

Other cryptocurrencies followed Bitcoin’s lead, as traders were cautious after the Fed meeting. With two consecutive days of declines, most altcoins have lost most of the ground they had gained last week.

World no.2 crypto Ether fell 4.4% to $3,690.32, extending its decline. World no.3 crypto XRP slumped more than 6% to $2.38.

Solana was 3.3% lower and Polygon slumped 6.2%, while Cardano fell more than 6%. Among meme tokens, Dogecoin lost 5.2%.

It fell below the $100,000 mark on Thursday after the Fed officials signaled a slower pace for future cuts. The world's largest cryptocurrency has fallen for five out of the last six days.

The Federal Reserve signaled a more hawkish stance, indicating only two interest rate cuts for the upcoming year, compared to prior expectations of two cuts.

This shift has led investors to reassess their positions in speculative assets like Bitcoin, contributing to its price decline.

Meanwhile, incoming U.S. President Donald Trump congratulated the crypto market on hitting a record peak of over $108,000, while speaking at an event in Phoenix.

Profit-taking also weighed on Bitcoin after it surged to record highs last week. Prospects of a strategic Bitcoin reserve had pushed prices to an all-time high of $108,244.9 on Tuesday, after which prices fell steadily.

It was the first weekly fall for Bitcoin since Trump’s election victory.

President-elect Donald Trump has nominated key figures for defense and crypto policy in his upcoming administration.

Michael Kratsios has been nominated to lead the Office of Science and Technology Policy. Kratsios, formerly with Scale AI, held tech-related roles in Trump’s first term and has been involved in the federal downsizing initiative led by Elon Musk.

Lynne Parker, Kratsios’ former deputy, will head the Presidential Council of Advisers for Science and Technology (PCAST), and Bo Hines, a former athlete and Republican congressional candidate, will lead the new Crypto Council.

Both councils will report to David Sacks, the ""crypto czar,"" who will divide his time between the White House and Silicon Valley.

Trump’s Truth Social posts on Sunday highlighted these and other personnel announcements as he prepares for his inauguration next month.

Other cryptocurrencies were largely down on Monday but moved in a close range as investors were still assessing the outlook for speculative assets after the hawkish Fed rattled investor sentiment.

Most altcoins have declined for several consecutive sessions, in line with Bitcoin’s movement.

World no.2 crypto Ether fell to $3,310.15, while world no.3 crypto XRP fell 4% to $2.178.

On the other hand, Solana lost 2.4% and Polygon declined 3.1%, while Cardano dropped 3.4%.

Among meme tokens, Dogecoin dipped 3.5%.

In other crypto-related news, North Korean hackers are believed to be behind 61% of cryptocurrency thefts this year, according to Chainalysis.

A recent report from the blockchain analysis firm highlights that hackers linked to North Korea stole around $660.5 million across 20 incidents in 2023. In 2024, that figure surged to $1.34 billion across 47 incidents, marking a 102.88% jump. This represents the highest annual total ever attributed to hackers from the country.

So far this year, North Korean actors have been tied to 47 crypto hacks, accounting for roughly two-thirds of all such incidents.
